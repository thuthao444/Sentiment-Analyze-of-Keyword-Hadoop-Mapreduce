I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be.

But just to emphasis, flipping a property to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a &quot;good&quot; choice, as current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house. You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE ! but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble. So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply. &quot;Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. &quot; As you said in the section &quot;What is the zestimate really ?&quot; they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the &quot;negotiation&quot; is downed.

The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn&#x27;t have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I&#x27;m currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I&#x27;m still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting. I&#x27;ve been reading a lot of theory (as that&#x27;s what most professors I&#x27;m interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming. Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they&#x27;re not embarrassed or feel like they&#x27;re holding the research back)?

Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn&#x27;t surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I&#x27;m extremely skeptical that it&#x27;s actively good for anyone.

The big data domain, so thats data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. Its all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, dont go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But thats boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. Thats it.

Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. &quot;Ok google&quot;, or &quot;hey Siri&quot; the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad.

I have also been accepted into GaTechs Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings. I really dont want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also dont have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there.

I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion. After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python. Since then I developed a true passion for programming. I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these. During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics. I am really undecided on which career to pursue. These are the things I like mostly: - programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering) - using Git and Github - discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science) - creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person. - languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue) I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely &quot;make more sense&quot; given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis.

<row Id="2445" PostId="2445" Score="6" Text="I&#x27;d personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it&#x27;s not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it&#x27;s not that important in what order I did it... Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don&#x27;t know how long it will take you (coz it&#x27;s new to you and you don&#x27;t know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don&#x27;t even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don&#x27;t get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress. Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning &amp; AI specialists. Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&amp;SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...)

I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn&#x27;t like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, &quot;Look Jeffrey, I know there&#x27;s way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?&quot; My response was, &quot;Uh... I&#x27;m willing to work,&quot; and he said, &quot;*sigh* Everyone&#x27;s willing to work.&quot; I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn&#x27;t for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald&#x27;s after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook&#x27;s Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I&#x27;m on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases.

As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are &quot;trending&quot;) put emphasis on data viz &amp; ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I&#x27;ve seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. I think it&#x27;s important to learn skills that are trending once you&#x27;re in the field, but until then it&#x27;s better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services).

And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models.

Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data, the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data. Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc.. Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. Machine learning, users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models. If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it.

I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one&#x27;s work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job. So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you&#x27;ll keep postponing it. Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future.

Whether the original dataset is already in a &quot;sanitized&quot; state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing &quot;notebooks&quot; show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data? Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is a model necessary? The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc. Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us.

The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University&#x27;s program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master&#x27;s program and switch to a different one."

Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen &quot;data scientists&quot; who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2) If you want to be a data scientist, you&#x27;ll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it&#x27;s taking 1 step back to take 3 forward. and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing &quot;cool&quot; projects.

You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice: you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you&#x27;ve learned over time :) Good luck everyone!" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it&#x27;s a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?"

I&#x27;m looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it. However, it&#x27;s not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There&#x27;s large room for improvement. Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community.

And it wasn&#x27;t just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :) And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the &quot;Silent Flute&quot;. The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the &#x27;master&#x27; was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age, it&#x27;s full of wisdoms! One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, &quot;seemed to know everything&quot; he simply answered with this: &quot;Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day.&quot; ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added &quot;... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.&quot; I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It&#x27;s incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -&gt; The kind that says sometimes it&#x27;s good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you&#x27;ll be working might give you ideas for the first one.

I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didnt do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice. 2. Hes using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but thats the command line interface to use git. Its also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu its be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you dont want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. (Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later)." CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

<row Id="5076" PostId="5076" Score="13" Text="&quot;We fail more then we success&quot; - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a &quot;real scientist&quot; (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all. One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I&#x27;m unemployed atm so I can&#x27;t have an imposter syndrome)... As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don&#x27;t remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn&#x27;t. Some problems can&#x27;t get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I&#x27;d like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain&#x27;t an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that&#x27;s an off-topic. The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn&#x27;t necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I&#x27;ve worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world&#x27;s top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country&#x27;s top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That&#x27;s why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things. I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don&#x27;t compare yourself to other people, you don&#x27;t know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today. I&#x27;m off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data. That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems.

This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION&gt;. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit. I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I&#x27;m just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it. When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment.

I have PhD in Materials Science and masters in both Materials Science and Mechanical Engineering (2 masters). I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well. What would you advise a person like me? I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don&#x27;t have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening."

<row Id="5347" PostId="5347" Score="9" Text="How Much Math do I need in Data Science? Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning I. Introduction If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind: Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background? What essential math skills are important in data science? There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include: Ggplot2 Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit-learn Caret TensorFlow PyTorch Keras Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. Its important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools. II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model Lets suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions: How big is my dataset? What are my feature variables and target variable? What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable? What features are important? Should I scale my features? How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets? What is principal component analysis (PCA)? Should I use PCA for removing redundant features? How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE? How can I improve the predictive power of the model? Should I use regularized regression models? What are the regression coefficients? What is the intercept? Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression? What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance? Without a sound math background, you wouldnt be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial. Lets now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning. III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning 1. Statistics and Probability Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Bayes Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation 2. Multivariable Calculus Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function 3. Linear Algebra Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors 4. Optimization Methods Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm) IV. Summary and Conclusion In summary, weve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, its important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm." CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient Thanks if you see this and all the amazing work you do! :D" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time. When you said, that you don&#x27;t think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don&#x27;t remember exactly where I have this &quot;way of thinking&quot; from, but it was very inspiring to me. Even if you (as in &quot;you&quot; personally) do not feel that you have achieved &quot;that&quot; much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done &quot;average&quot; or &quot;somewhat well&quot;, but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You&#x27;re awesome! :)" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it&#x27;s volatile. Don&#x27;t get me wrong, it&#x27;s good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can&#x27;t really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;) Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I&#x27;ve talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you&#x27;ve accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won&#x27;t always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it.

The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that&#x27;s where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career. I&#x27;m currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well.

There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook: 1. You don&#x27;t always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models. 2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion. There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section. I am not saying it&#x27;s entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%.

Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts ), also noticed that you&#x27;re using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips!

The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R. So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky. Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month. I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge. I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge. Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops.

The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from urllib.request import urlopen,Request import pandas as pd import random import pickle headers = {&quot;User-Agent&quot;: &quot;Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3&quot;} website = &quot;https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm&quot; for i in range(1): req = Request(website, headers=headers) page = urlopen(req) soup = BeautifulSoup(page, &#x27;html.parser&#x27;) for item in soup.select(&quot;.jobLink span&quot;): print(item.get_text()) Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page."

<row Id="6467" PostId="6467" Score="6" Text="Hello there :) I haven&#x27;t watched the full video yet, but there&#x27;s a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I&#x27;d like to propose to you for similar videos in the future: Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this. And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won&#x27;t hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience). SO my suggestion is this: Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :) Signed: A total newbie at this."

Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won&#x27;t look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn&#x27;t want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won&#x27;t be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell&#x27;s , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That&#x27;s how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn&#x27;t shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. Cheers and All the best . People are good but people who share credits are great. Peace!"

Now when I follow along with someone&#x27;s project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say &#x27;many&#x27; enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault." CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />
<row Id="6694" PostId="6694" Score="11" Text="This is a very important topic, I agree! As you have said, using someone else&#x27;s code is very common in DS or just tech in general, however it is important to credit the people correctly. Some people may think &quot;I could have written that code myself&quot;, which can of course be true in some situations, but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature. If you use a normal sentence such as &quot;the weather was nice&quot; obviously you don&#x27;t need to quote anyone. But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source. Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in tech than it is in literature. Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear! Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one&#x27;s self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don&#x27;t credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!"

As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I&#x27;m sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do&#x27;s for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I&#x27;ve briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful. Finally I have one last question, I&#x27;ve researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven&#x27;t found any satisfactory answer to a question. What&#x27;s it like to be a Data Scientist, I&#x27;m not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much &quot;me&quot; time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I&#x27;m eager to know the &quot;life&quot; side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist. Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I&#x27;ll be really glad if you respond.

You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters&#x27; eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I&#x27;m also unaware of the do&#x27;s and dont&#x27;s.

Your channel is actually the first channel I&#x27;ve ever subscribed to, because from the first video that I saw on your channel about whether one should choose a bootcamp, a certificate or a masters&#x27; degree, I&#x27;ve been hooked to your channel and have seen most of your videos. First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I&#x27;d like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I&#x27;ve seen a plethora of videos and then I&#x27;ve realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I&#x27;m trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I&#x27;d be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this. As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I&#x27;d suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I&#x27;m a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because - 1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool 2. Seeing the specs I&#x27;m sure this machine will be crazy fast and that&#x27;ll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time 3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help!

For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward.

<row Id="7478" PostId="7478" Score="33" Text="I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn&#x27;t quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it&#x27;s not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5. What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it&#x27;s mostly pointless. The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it&#x27;s only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches. Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don&#x27;t see how it makes any sense at all. Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort? Finally, I&#x27;m not sure if it&#x27;s correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it&#x27;s not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn&#x27;t recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower. My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn&#x27;t seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations. For processor I&#x27;d get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it&#x27;s available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice. For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I&#x27;d recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn&#x27;t get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects. For motherboard I&#x27;d recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good. For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn&#x27;t get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences. For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn&#x27;t get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice. Monitor doesn&#x27;t really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do. Graphic card is a tricky one. I&#x27;d probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it&#x27;s hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I&#x27;d recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I&#x27;d get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available. As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it&#x27;s quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C. Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we. Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks."

And then I had to change my major to something related, so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before. But even now I still feel like compared to data science, my major doesn&#x27;t seem to be that professional. So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses. Do you think a self-taught grad student who majored in IT management would be okay to get a job as a data engineer in 2 years?" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I&#x27;m trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers? Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc) to get my dataset ready? Or what am i supposed to do? Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling... I&#x27;m kinda lost and can&#x27;t find any good resource to solve this... Thank so much you and keep the good work!" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

<row Id="7993" PostId="7993" Score="17" Text="Nice video! I&#x27;m not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn: --------------- 1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you&#x27;re using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can&#x27;t, not playing with margins) --------------- 2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don&#x27;t understand much that they&#x27;re talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what&#x27;s happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you&#x27;re trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I&#x27;m much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape. 2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I&#x27;ve often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that&#x27;s part of a standard library. --------------- 3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I&#x27;d encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development --------------- 4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it&#x27;s super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it&#x27;s also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it&#x27;s all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work. --------------- Again great video and I hope the data dump&#x27;s welcomed:)" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks. 3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts). All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid.

When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about &quot;selection&quot;, one of the key steps to learning. In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms. Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages. How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines. Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!"

<row Id="8219" PostId="8219" Score="24" Text="I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills. HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach. People who learn exclusive via doing especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of. Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. There are multiple factors underlying this problem. First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference. This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above. The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they dont know. In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions. While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches. In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you dont know how to optimally use even the tools you do have. For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community. So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education; even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself. The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years. As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience. The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity. For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling. This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI. Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide. As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training. Sadly, many of us who dont get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs. So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier. Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often dont learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc, So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development? The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW. Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more. We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches. So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhDs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives? First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base. Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in.

So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhDs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives. First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn. Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift. You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit. Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas. Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine. And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative. In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit let alone intern/apprenticeship training. Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge? Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction. So, dont migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so."

When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project. Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable?

<row Id="8909" PostId="8909" Score="4" Text="Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. Were not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, almost no companies know what data science is. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: its the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. Thats it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. Im telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesnt say data scientist doesnt mean your not going to do data science work. Im a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server, Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDEs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of must know Python, its a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist dont know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldnt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print hello world in Python. Yet theyre interviewing candidates for Python development. If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. Good luck!" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it&#x27;s too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn&#x27;t do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I&#x27;m mostly working with R.

I&#x27;m an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it&#x27;s also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages&#x27; documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I&#x27;m relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes.

I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve? Thank you for all your videos!" CreationDate="2011-09-16T08:00:53.557" UserId="12345" />

OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB&#x27;s on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off?

<row Id="9892" PostId="9892" Score="-5" Text="Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket. With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop. Basketball&#x27;s offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined. Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today&#x27;s NBA as the rules are currently set up. When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game. Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game. If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game. The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix."

<row Id="9970" PostId="9970" Score="17" Text="Great resolutions! Some of my comments: 1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a &quot;good code&quot; by engineers. But obviously if you can&#x27;t efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren&#x27;t ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting &quot;classic&quot; code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both. 2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be &quot;consumed&quot; at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don&#x27;t have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it&#x27;s rather inefficient. 3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it! 4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it&#x27;s like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don&#x27;t change as often. 5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time. My resolutions: 1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels. NOT being just a &quot;cog&quot; in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work. 2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels. 3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren&#x27;t data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo) 4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML 5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert 6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don&#x27;t have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what&#x27;s going on in our field) 7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I&#x27;ve been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I&#x27;ll be able to make it useful soon!

Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time.
