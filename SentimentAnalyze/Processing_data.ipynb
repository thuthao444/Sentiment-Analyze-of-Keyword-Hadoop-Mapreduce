      "0 Thanks for this video Ken. I decided to go into Tech in 2018 by learning web development. Learnt a bit of HTML, CSS and Javascript. My goals has since evolved through this period as I got interested in python programming and Data science. My current interest now tends towards deep learning and AI Interesting my knowledge of front end web development will be very helpful in web scraping.\n",
      "1 Hello ken jee!!! I'm doing a graduation on Computer Science and i really keen to learn Data Science. From where should i start? learning Python basics? If you have any resources of learning Python, could you help me providing the link? To be honest my excitement to learning data science get on the top notch after watching your this video. \n",
      "2 Thanks for this video, man. So useful. I'll meet you when I'm a Senior Lead Data Scientist at the Company I work for\n",
      "3 Great video!!! I started learning Python 8 months ago and quickly became interested in DS, I have a background in Finace/Econ but never worked in finance (I have a construction business), my goal is to learn DS and work with investments. Having said all that im considering a boot camp and even a masters in DS, I would love to get your opinion on that. Thanks\n",
      "4 Been watching hours of your material (and Tina) because while I do know that it is not an easy field, Ive been fascinated by it ever since I first found out about it. Data Analysis is my passion and the one thing I feel I came to the world for, and this role I feel like its the pinnacle of it. I will not give up.\n",
      "5 Hey Ken! I am almost finishing my university degreed in market research & marketing and I am going to focus in data science/data engineering. Currently my friends are telling me to buy a M1 Macbook but I am not sure about compatibilities with OSX and I am not familiarised with Macs (I have always being a Windows user). Do you think it is a good idea or is it better to stick with this Zbooks or any other similar Windows laptop?\n",
      "6 So basically is it modest to say that the silver bullet to get into a good role is: to have had Software Engineer/Development education + experience Else to have been submerged in roles in your current situation (sometimes very unlikely) analyst to scientist if none of the above, then to get either of the three things (recommended but not required) but without a work portfolio (professional or otherwise) it is intensively hard\n",
      "7 Hi Ken, as always, your videos are insightful and easy to follow. Would you say that one of the main distinctions between a data analyst and a data scientist is that the analyst focuses on what happened? While the scientist is looking for future possible outcomes? Thanks so much again for your hard work in helping us!\n",
      "8 Watching this for a second time while working out because, well, I'm a huge geek and a fanboi.\n",
      "9 Any good resume templates I can use?\n",
      "10 Like Bayesian probably\n",
      "11 Hey Ken! Great introductory video! Thanks :) i have been doing small projects involving blockchain. For example, I scrape blockchain data but i do it using beautifulsoup and selenium. There are APIs but most are not well documented and are not free. When you said new tools to work with blockchain data, what do you mean? Also, if you are looking for projects, i would love to brainstorm with you and come up with ideas. I am already working on one and would be great to discuss it with you :)\n",
      "12 Hey Ken! I would love to hear opinion from you regarding your graduate program at DePaul. Do you think it is a good program for someone without formal CS background? I studied Quantitative Economics as undergrad without programming experience, except statistical programs like eViews, Stata and SPSS. I am currently doing internship at Fortune 200 company as Data Analyst where I will craft my Data Modelling, Analysis and Visualization skills using ( Power) Excel, PowerBI, SQL, Python Spark, matplotlib, pandas etc.\n",
      "13 Thank you sir \n",
      "14 Great! Now I can just shove this video in my parents' face next time they ask me what I plan on doing later on in life LMAO\n",
      "15 Sir I'm from Bangladesh. I am doing bachelor in math. Can I go for data science?\n",
      "16 Hey Ken! What I have to choose in between Bachelor of business administration major in Finance or IT..to continue in data Science?!\n",
      "17 Thank you for the amazing series. Was really helpful\n",
      "18 Danger Will Robinson! It's always about the $$$$$.\n",
      "19 Why did he / you ignore r studio column in df_model ?\n",
      "20 Is it just me or glassdoor has made its html scrape-proof? I tried reproducing the code but I couldn't comprehend how I could access the elements with company name, salary est., location, etc. The elements are just divs with job ids in class name and no extra attributes to access them. Anyone have a workaround, please help? If possible, can anyone share the link with the dataset you scraped because I really want to follow along with the tutorial. Thanks in advance\n",
      "21 Thank you for your video always !! But I want Korean subtitle !! :)\n",
      "22 Wow, this video is brilliant. My only problem is that the title looks like a clickbait when it actually delivers what it promises haha. So much chatter around data science these days but very few voices really know the field and of those even fewer have the clarity and generosity to share it in approachable/useful videos like this. Congratulations for the quality of your work and a big thank you.\n",
      "23 what a guy \n",
      "24 thank you for the high quality videos\n",
      "25 Hey Ken! I was wondering what you think about many people using a single account on Netflix or Amazon prime video? It must impact the recommendation generated for that account but also affect user-user similarity used for recommendations.\n",
      "26 Arrrrrgggghhhhhh.......... the audio!!\n",
      "27 it isn't relevant to data science but successfully you catch attention!\n",
      "28 really catch the trend\n",
      "29 A boring answer yet practical.\n",
      "30 I'm 40, want to live in Asia and work remotely. Which should I choose?\n",

      "32 Is it realisable to apply deep learning on a real project after four months starting from scratch in this field ?\n",
      "33 xqcL\n",
      "34 Just saw your comment on another video. It reminds me that I was an audience of u in 2019. Long time no see, Ken !! Glad to see u have almost 200k followers right now~~ Congrats!\n",
      "35 Hey Ken, can you make a video for highschool students who want to learn more about data science..?\n",
      "36 Audios a bit off \n",
      "37 Who owns kaggle\n",
      "38 As a data scientist, that sounds really interesting. Could you expand on it more in future videos?\n",
      "39 KEN! When are you dropping the Papaya NFT collection?!?! #TheNFTsWeNeed #PapayasIncToTheMoon\n",
      "40 If you enjoy work with data cryptography, niche databases (a lot of projects have their own way of QB and , graph data ... then web3 data science could be interesting for you.\n",
      "41 ah I thought you were gonna say you never did it :x\n",
      "42 I am excited PERIOD\n",
      "43 Great video. Interesting that we sort of agree on the whole thing. Ive been stressing this for a while. The true way to make money in AI (especially in the Web 3 context) is through Data. People often think of big models and fancy architectures in Machine Learning, but that's not the major component\n",
      "44 So its already Jan 17. Am I too late to start my #66DaysofData?\n",
      "45 Loved your analysis of web 3, Ken! I've also recently researched a bit about blockchain for my CS study. Totally agreed, a lot of loose ends on the web 3 discussion that still needs to be solved before it can become mainstream.\n",
      "46 Nice perspective. As a computational chemist applying ML methods I'm always highly suspicious about people being too excited about any new methodology. And even though I am a retail investor in crypto projects I just can't imagine most narratives to come true.\n",
      "47 Tell me this position is bad while repeatedly beating it into my soul this position is bad.\n",
      "48 Awesome explanation Ken!!\n",
      "49 All Ken's videos during the past year had perfect audio quality .. I think this is just some kind of bug or unexpected thing during editing or upload .. The video is very interesting though so I hope everyone can overlook this one time issue and focus on the topic \n",
      "50 As a data librarian web 3 will be instrumental in making data resources more accessible.\n",
      "51 Perfect timing with this video! I've had some articles about web3 on my reading list, so really glad you've nicely introduced us to this topic :)\n",
      "52 So should I expect a ken and Avery colab? \n",
      "53 What I am confused on Data Science and AI with the development of web 3 is, if the data are publicly available- I guess (more like believe) the owner of the data would be kept anonymous. Although there is plenty of data out in the web, how would the business make strategies to reach to their audiences/customers? Wouldn't it be like television/radio/newspaper ads? Also, how would the services reach to their probable new customers/audiences? Basically how would AI work for recommendation and how would business collect data to grow their business? I don't think the recommendation system would be like throwing anything to the public what they want people to see (not what people want to see.). Facebook and Youtube are not hurt.\n",
      "54 Bad audio quality\n",
      "55 I think video has a audio issue. But I watched completely. Looking forward to read more about web3\n",
      "56 Bro your voice has a problem\n",
      "57 I believe irrespective of your field exploring blockchain is must to explore topic in current times.\n",
      "58 Secret web 3 project with?!? What!!!!! That sounds exciting. But seriously, every transaction being publicly available is a pretty cool idea, but also kinda scary. Think about your credit card bill being public. \n",
      "59 I was eagerly waiting for your opinion on this topic.\n",
      "60 Can you please share how to get started a career in web3 ?\n",
      "61 great video, thanks for advice!\n",
      "62 Hey Can you suggest me some beginner python ml ds related projects for college project for college.. And also if you suggest any specific course or video on guide of how should i approach learning ds\n",
      "63 Thanks for watching everyone! New web 3 project is going to be an analysis of some web 3 data! What type of web 3 data would you be interested in seeing us analyze? Also, I apologize for the audio poorer audio quality on this one. Using a new camera and I guess I didn't tune it right!\n",
      "64 I noticed in this video you mention the tools used for a Data Scientist but don't say too much about the math that's used regularly. This seems to be a common trend on \"How to Become a Data Scientist\" videos. They almost exclusively talk about learning Python, R, SQL etc. but rarely go into any detail on the math involved in the field. I'm in a masters program for Data Science and it's pretty heavily math focused to begin. Just an idea for a future video. Anyway, thanks for consistently putting content out, you're videos have really helped me in understanding the direction I want to go!\n",
      "65 Is WSL 2, or just linux in general, something I should be familiar with before getting my first job as a data scientist? What resources should I use to learn?\n",
      "66 Bro you recently suggest me a NLP(beginner) related video. And it was great I got lot from it... Would u plzz suggest me some more but must have a professional level NLP (project type or tutorial will also do the job) video. Thanks again \n",
      "67 Just because you do not take an interest in politics doesn't mean politics won't take an interest in you. I think same is happening these days, Just because you do not take an interest in data science doesn't mean Data Science won't take an interest in you.\n",
      "68 This video will be definitely useful for some of my friends or data science aspirants but I think it requires little base to understand some terms as some are completely unaware about it\n",
      "69 Both ad campaign are good like In 1st case ppl will impacted by doctors advice and in 2nd case 25% off\n",
      "70 Sir I got selected for data scientist internship.in that internship they will calculate performance evaluation ... please give me some suggestions sir.. what are courses are most useful for data scientist job\n",
      "71 Data Science: 1.excell 2.SQL 3.python 4.tableue 5.Statistics SPSS 6.tensorflow 7.pandas/numby 8.IDE Jupyter\n",
      "72 How about don't learn data science lol. I'm sorry but the only benefit is that it pays REALLY well. It lacks creativity, is stressful because of the pressure that corporations put on your utilitarian \"skills\" you bring to the table to asses and translate data. Its a hard job. I'd pass.\n",
      "73 this video doesnt explain or demonstrate anything about devs enviroment or how to save your work\n",

      "75 As a data engineer at the largest shipping company in the world, I can tell you this: a data scientist is nothing without a data engineer and a data engineer is nothing without a software engineer. You need the three of them working together.\n",
      "76 No\n",
      "77 Hi Ken, I'm 37 years old and from Banking industry. Studied accountancy and economics. I have been contemplating about doing data science for past a couple of years as i have never felt too confident about it. Data is definitely important but people doing masters/major in statistics will have upper hand to people who are doing data science course with no prior engineering background. Also, people who know various coding languages might again have upper hand. Rest you have in the job training. Please share your response. I want to learn data science but I'm not feeling too confident about it's future for someone with my background.\n",
      "78 Will really love to see more of this story telling content ...so educative and interesting\n",
      "79 Any full playlist that of data science you have taught from scratch ?\n",
      "80 Even with all these \"strange\" job aspects, I still decided to take the job because of the once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to work with Ken!! #PapayasIncToTheMoon #WeAreGonnaBuildSoManyPapayaDashboardsKen\n",
      "81 Hello, Where do i learn about pc hardware specs for beginners.\n",
      "82 I've had this many times in my field as well. Sad, they think they're doing you a favor\n",
      "83 Ah, I see you've met my former employer\n",
      "84 I mean if ken's offering it, he should take it blindly, I mean he gets ken as his coworker what else can anyone ask for? \n",
      "85 this aint even a joke lol\n",
      "86 Love your videos \n",
      "87 I just finished an online bootcamp course and this content effectively summarizes what I've learned thus far. This solidified my knowledge and I'm glad to know that I'm on the right track. I hope you keep on making content like this to educate people like us who aspire to practice a career in the fascinating Data Science field!!\n",
      "88 Thanks for this straightforward and in-depth explanation! I'm a beginner in DS, and I'm looking forward to applying it in my practice as a biomedical scientist, especially with a focus on infectious diseases.\n",
      "89 Wow this is so interesting! How crazy the consequences of unsupervised machine learning that went wrong. Great video, Ken! Very well done! I really enjoyed this kind of analysis of real life problems we're facing.\n",
      "90 https://youtu.be/p4MPvter1Ng pandas tutorials\n",
      "91 This will be a great help \n",
      "92 Worth to watch video for a beginner like me before embarking onto the data science learning journey,\n",
      "93 Great insights .\n",
      "94 I think it's interesting that you differntiate Data Science from Statistics. I guess it's a matter of semantics but I've never heard someone else say that\n",
      "95 You give us a clear introduction for data scientist, thanks.\n",
      "96 My only complaint might be that they made it too easy and the value of the cert might not be that high.\n",
      "97 great stuff! I am in the process of hopefully moving into the Data Science world for my career and your videos are huge helps in my research to learn and understand in order to make the correct decisions for myself and career. Keep them coming.\n",
      "98 Man your voice is so so good...I mean full of confidence and energetic...I really love your voice and your valuable tips too \n",
      "99 Thank you so much. I have a quick question. I am mid-career and switching to data science. After completing your suggested course work on this video, how necessary do you believe an MS degree would be? Thanks again. I look forward to hearing from you. Jackie\n",
      "100 Awesome! I love its simplicity. Well done, Ken!\n",
      "101 I am just here for the Z shirt.\n",
      "102 Bayesian Learning will be very important. The BBN ability to operate probabilistically and work with incomplete evidence is quite powerful. It can also allow for interesting dataset quality/Imputation checks. I don't know why more people don't talk about this\n",
      "103 Is there a way to make the links in the page open on a new tab instead of the same tab?\n",
      "104 Love the explanation of what DS is currently. It feels to me like the most interesting work is where the limits of our understanding math and the limits of computing power meet, forcing innovations. Great vid as always!\n",
      "105 Just sent this to my brother and parents. Thanks ken :D\n",
      "106 Thank you so helpful!\n",
      "107 6:32 or if it was smashed or not\n",
      "108 Another great example outside of data science is medical laboratory science. Over the years it has become more and more automated with more machines doing lab tests.. but all that has created is the ability to do more volume. We need people to interpret the results and make sure they are okay. Machines break down all the time and the job is VERY much in demand.\n",
      "109 Really helpful even to data science aspirants. \n",
      "110 People need it. If they say they don't they are hiring the skills under multiple / different job titles.\n",
      "111 great video I will kindly request to make a video of deep learning\n",
      "112 Great episode once again. My learnings is to create a journal to write down what youre learning, how you did it and what next. And Ill take it a step further and share it with the world. Thank you for sharing this conversation\n",
      "113 Great vido man! Clear and i think it's a good definition :)\n",
      "114 i want to know what are the tools they use means did they work in jupyter notebooks or google collab in which software do they do the whole process pls reply\n",
      "115 Hi Ken, in 4:15 of your video, you mentioned Geography. I have basic to intermediate experience in GIS (spatial) data and geostatistics and working on improving my data wrangling, programming and ML skills in order to land a role as a geospatial data analyst/scientist. Thanks for this short and insightful video, I was watching your content since 2020 when started my journey in learning data analytics.\n",
      "116 Very Well Explained, thanks Ken\n",
      "117 Hi Ken! Great video. Can you also explain the role and responsibilites of a full stack data scientist too in one of your videos please ?\n",
      "118 2:56 theres a typo and my dyslexic brain told me to read it as 'orgasming' data dont ask how, great video btw\n",
      "119 Great video Ken. You got any tips on how to get on the path of learning data science?\n",
      "120 Allow me to comment on how much I admire your relationship with your parents ! I hope to see them reacting to one of your videos sometime Haha. Awesome video Ken ! When my family asks what I do I'll just send them this lol .. They probably won't ask tho :3\n",
      "121 What about PySpark? Does it also make sense to pay attention to it? And what could be a possible private project example?\n",
      "122 THE EXPLANATION WE HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR!! ...also... I hope it's okay... but now I'm going to drop a video next week titled: \"The Only DATA ANALYTICS Explanation You Need\" jk\n",
      "123 overfitting underfitting and bias invariance tradeoff please\n",
      "124 Great explanation!\n",
      "125 Yes please! Explain all those topics. Im a new to this.\n",
      "126 Great review. I forgot a lot of these topics since it's been a while since I've been introduced to these concepts.\n",
      "127 Would LOVE to hear the application of deep learning in DS. Right now I only hear about deep learning when it comes to voice recognition / natural language processing type of things\n",
      "128 Ken, are you wearing a smart ring?\n",
      "129 Monday's are always much better with a Ken Jee video! Perfect way to start the week and great video Ken!\n",
      "130 Papaya Easter eggs inside another great, informative video = pure genius Fantastic job as always.\n",
      "131 I agree, this is the only explanatory video about data science that one needs, and yet simple and concise :)\n",
      "132 Amazing video, very informative and well structured as always\n",
      "133 Are data science and pizza related?\n",
      "134 Hey Ken! I am a final year computer science student, I have started following Data science just 2-3 months back and I am intending to do a final year project on the same. The issue is that I have to learn data science from the basics, by myself, from the internet. I have only 3 and half months. Can you recommend any good course of Machine Learning with Data Science? Pretty much stressed I am!\n",
      "135 This is an Amazing Data science explained so well Really like the example used and how everything is simplified .\n",
      "136 7:57 yes, want a video like this on deep learning. + Do you need a pretty powerful PC for deep learning?\n",
      "137 Great message Ken! Clear and concise!\n",
      "138 great video!\n",
      "139 Great video, Ken! One of the first examples of Data Science(though it was not called Data Science then) comes from John Snows famous map of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak. Before germ theory was known, it was thought that Cholera was simply in the environment and that it spread at random. John Snow conducted interviews, mapped data points and graphed the results, leading to a single water pump being identified as the culprit. This was founding moment in Epidemiology and Public Health. Just sharing my learnings as well. Cheers :D\n",
      "140 Oooo a lot of editing in this video you're really making your editor work hard , anyway great video really informative, ty for the content once again. Papaya bomb at 6:31\n",
      "141 As always Ken, superbly done. Concise and brief without getting into too much jargon and getting to the pith of it.\n",
      "142 Would love to see video on Deep Learning\n",
      "143 This is the real truth.\n",
      "144 Informative as usual! Really nicely explained Ken. Now I will just send this video if someone asked me to explain about Data Science\n",
      "145 Ken this was informative, thank you. Also, I love to see the other video about regression, classification etc.\n",

      "149 I think with ML I've had to deal with writing testing protocols for evaluating multiple kinds of protocols. That seems to be something that a lot of online courses miss\n",
      "150 Sir thank you so much for sharing knowledge and awareness But I AM NOT GONNA QUIT Even if it's difficult I will make it\n",
      "151 Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know below if you would be interested in a similar video to this for Deep Learning or Model Evaluation! \n",
      "152 As an accountant I can tell you the reason why you are not seeing any data scientists in small to midsize companies is because they cannot justify the head count. Sure Amazon can have a whole department for data science but a small business you might be the marketing/finance guy who is also analyzing the other data sets for the company. The field is not dying, but with tight budgets in small to midsize companies it is hard to justify hiring hiring someone who specializes in data science but cannot do any other core business function. But that will probably change as time goes on. Also, as companies grow then the need for data scientists will grow as well.\n",
      "153 Hey Ken! I know this is an old video, but I was watching this again to plan a project that I am planning to work on. At the exploratory analysis part, you say that age looks like it is normally distributed. However, I'm pretty sure that if we run a Shapiro-Wilk test on it, it will turn out to be non-normal. So, I am wondering what do you mean by 'looks normally distributed' here? Are you looking for extremely skewed distributions to normalize? Thanks! Go #66daysofdata =)\n",
      "154 What about PG program\n",
      "155 I have a history B's and I am basically starting from scratch self teaching myself about programing and data science. Thank you for providing multiple pathways to the end result because I cannot afford to return to college but have time and am willing to learn on my own time. I'm a lost 24 yo and seeing this calmly explained with lots helpful learning tips. This is what YouTube is still great for. Thank you....year old video so I doubt that you or anyone will see it but still thank you\n",
      "156 I like how he says algorithm and techniques in 6:50 and show us the descending slope. As if he were referring to gradient descent. ?\n",
      "157 Yes, I agree I will watch you again!\n",
      "158 In my surroundings I can tell that the reason why students aren't taking data science is because they find statistics too hard and also consider web development and devops as a likeable and easy field.\n",
      "159 Sir I want to make a career as a soccer analyst.Can you please recommend some books on soccer analytics\n",
      "160 No its because someones clearly hacking my account but nobody cares!\n",
      "161 I agree with everything said in this video! Nice to see new content from you in the new year.\n",
      "162 This interview looked like a struggle lmao. Ken we see you yawning with your mouth closed \n",
      "163 These are not my personal goals, just how I see Data Science. Data science as i see it.... Goal 1. Stalk and Harrass. Goal 2. Manipulation and deception. Goal 3. Ripoff the naive and uninitiated.\n",
      "164 Of course it will exist. The world needs vampires. These are not my personal goals, just how I see Data Science. Data science as i see it.... Goal 1. Stalk and Harrass. Goal 2. Manipulation and deception. Goal 3. Ripoff the naive and uninitiated.\n",
      "165 This seems to be a silly thing that I see all the time with anything connected to coding. I've been learning to code (and now getting into data science) for about a year and a half. I have seen so many comments like is JavaScript dying? Is web development dying? Is Deno dead already? Even when people ask \"Is JQuery dead?'\" then you realise how many sites still use JQuery. The answer to the \"Is it dead/dying?\" question is usually \"no\"\n",
      "166 I would say very beautiful Readme.\n",
      "167 Very cool project. Ken you should continue this Playlist in 2022.\n",
      "168 its all about Doing projects, projects and Projects..........\n",
      "169 Great Video\n",
      "170 My immediate reaction was \"how do I know 90% of people aren't cheating on this\" and that discouraged me from taking it.\n",
      "171 One friend whos a principal ML engineer at Kopernikus automotive told me that the best way to show your skills in ML is to have projects, products or contributing to open source. No badges or certificates will replace that.\n",

      "173 Hey man, wanted to ask where you got your wallpaper ;)\n",
      "174 Hey Ken, Thanks for the useful video, I am very interested in learning data science, but I am not sure if I can pursue it because I have got like 0 knowledge about it , could you help? Love from India\n",
      "175 Although one year old but still worth to watch for anyone who wants to build deep learning portfolio.\n",
      "176 I was initially excited by the ML assessment, doubly so when I scored in the top 5%, but the second that excitement wore off I realized that the assessment was too weak to mean anything. Almost as confirmation of this, a friend of mine who doesn't do Data Science or ML passed it on a whim (he then proceeded to score in the top 5% of 4 or 5 other CS related assessments). Certifications need to be *hard* in order to carry any weight, a lesson many people seem extremely reluctant to learn.\n",

      "178 Hi Sir , currently i am pursuing my 3rd years of bachelor's degree in cse. Due to covid and many other reasons , it will take more time than expected to complete my bachelor's degree. So is it possible that if I start learning data science from scratch (which i am doing right now) and then get a job in data science field before completing my bachelor's degree in cse? second question is can I apply for a master's degree on data science or related field while doing my bachelor's degree? Thanks in advance\n",
      "179 First time to your channel Great advice thank you. I am going to start with all the points you said.. Right video at the right time :)\n",
      "180 Did Cyber security is better than Data Science jobs?\n",
      "181 Thank you for all the information that you share. I've spent several months considering the proper career switch after deciding not to return to medical school. At this point, I'm confident that data science is the proper career path. My overarching goal is to use data science in healthcare, but I am open to other fields. I found your channel today, and I want to say I am already grateful for your content and the resources you share. In addition to this video, I watched a video this evening in which you mentioned that Jan 4 is your bday. Happy Belated Birthday. May you continue to experience joy and success.\n",
      "182 Watching in early 2022. I really like this breakdown of process and how to think about solving problems. I'm a musician, producer and recording engineer and a lot of these....learn-by-doing and divergent thought processes remind me a lot of how to get a good mix or composing. Really excited on this journey\n",
      "183 Watching it again and starting to think if my struggling to learn python and pandas as well itnis not impatiance? Yes, at little.\n",
      "184 Thanks for sharing your thoughts on the assessment.\n",
      "185 Dude, next time you do this, please just stop going up and down the page. It gave me nausea :(\n",
      "186 I give you FIVE STAR for this video . I agree with what you have said. For Corp HR who put such rocky assessment management to do such idea in the first place. Then the question why we say degree in college or certification in boot camp created by pro in the field and not HR clerks in a corporate. Thanks.\n",
      "187 This video is extremely accurate. I have had such a hard time learning how to be a data scientist. I am in a MS in Data Analytics program and feel that doesn't really provide any real direction. I don't know what I don't know and that keeps me from learning what I need to know. Seeing the path helps, thank you. I would like to say I have struggled to learn R and I seem to be getting SQL quickly and I think this will help my confidence. Getting one language down can help to learn another, just from a confidence standpoint.\n",
      "188 Is that taking the paid course is good choice for data science?\n",
      "189 Hi Ken, thank you for your videos. I have a question, I am software developer with 8 years experience. Mostly Web, PHP, SQL, GO, I decided to start learning machine learning, here is a lot of Python and so on, what do you think if person like me, firstly, will change position to data analyst and continue to learn ML ? Is it right decision ? Thank you.\n",
      "190 Yea. I agree about your thoughts on the credibility of this assessment. But even as a business leader, I cannot imagine this helps either. Business leaders should understand how Machine Learning can affect their products, services, and branding. I cannot imagine that knowing what the nearest point in a K-nearest neighbor algorithm matters at all to them.\n",
      "191 I like LinkedIn but had no idea they had an ML assessment. Thanks for sharing!\n",
      "192 Very helpful Been thinking a career move to Data Science and your video is all I needed. Thank you so much\n",
      "193 True, I have one and you're right.\n",
      "194 What are your thoughts on Datacamp?\n",
      "195 I am learning how to build predictive models by watching videos and working alongside on another screen. It's really satisfying to see your code work. Especially when you start to experiment with your own parameters. Why do you think Python is more important to learn than R? Is it more versatile? I'm learning both, I'm just curious what you think.\n",
      "196 Ken, Thank you for the video. I believe LinkedIn's Job Search algorithm is more optimized if one has the preferred skill badge. It helps the user find relevant companies rather than help companies find skilled applicants. Let me know if you agree. Thank you again for your videos. I really enjoy them.\n",
      "197 Completely agree, I took this assessment applying for jobs this year, but it doesn't provide any value for people taking it or people hiring!\n",
      "198 I did not use Google for the this assessment and got top 15%, which is great IMO. But I do agree that terminology-based quick test is not really proof of any real-world DS/ML skill.\n",
      "199 This was such a fun conversation to watch! Learned a lot. Thank you for this! Definitely following Daniel!\n",
      "200 Hey, I have started my journey on learning data science. And, the math is what I find the most overwhelming, so much that I almost dropped the idea but curiosity gets the better of me and keeps on track. Being from non CS background, I feel really lost and tired when it comes to mathematics involved. Could you please share the maths topics and their sub topics that I should focus on and get as proefficient in it. I will be absolutely grateful if you get a chance to share the same and if any resources that I should refer to.\n",
      "201 Definitely coming back to this video. This is a fantastic set of questions\n",
      "202 Assessments don't matter if no one else cares\n",
      "203 WOWZER!\n",
      "204 From my perspective these assessments are more for candidates than for employers. You can take test and compare your result with others. The questions are interesting and not trivial, about algorithms, theory, different methods. Why not. I think that coding skill is secondary.\n",
      "205 Thanks. Your video will save many people's time. I wonder what will happen if your video is shared on LinkedIn lol\n",
      "206 So I took this on two accounts (my main account and my burner account). The one on my main account I took without cheating and I was curious to see how I'd do. I took it almost exactly one year ago today (apparently, I took it on 1/5/21) and I passed and it's on my profile because I got in that top 30%. When I got hired and throughout all of my interviews, it literally never came up. Not once. Nobody was like, \"hey, we noticed this on your profile.\" They saw my math undergrad degree, my stats grad degree I was finishing, my research, and work experience. On my main burner account, I took it to see if it's possible to cheat all the answers and it's super easy. I could give this to my sister who hates anything related to math/stats/programming, and if she googled all the questions she'd pass and get it on her profile. Definitely useless as an assessment. Nice video homie.\n",
      "207 Hi Ken, have taken the Machine Learning assessment and passed but I never saw true value in the assessment.\n",
      "208 I've always regarded LinkedIn assessments as \"fluff.\"\n",
      "209 Good points. I do think maybe this cert could show that a manager knows what various ML terms mean, but that's about it.\n",
      "210 Ken, hear me out on this one... The people NEED a \"Ken Jee Approved for Data Science Assessment\" on LinkedIn! Now that's an assessment I (and others... I think...) would take!!!\n",
      "211 Hey Ken! Great video! I havent taken the ML assessment, but did take Python and SQL quizzes. Passed both, but I believe companies shouldnt put significant weight on LinkedIn badges. Specifically, Python and SQL assessments tested very specific knowledge that arent necessarily useful to me in my projects. My criticism is based on the assumption that these assessments are designed for testing someone if they are qualified to worked at LinkedIn. With that, it is a great idea if LinkedIn can add a feature for one to display their projects. After all, experience comes from practice, no :)\n",
      "212 Yes, it is such a big downer to know statistics but to dont be able to do a fing simple thing because absolutely nothing works and you can take 3 hours surfing from one topic to another on stackoverflow because you cant even ch ange the color of a table. I miss Spss so much\n",
      "213 I completely agree. I was nervous to take the ML assessment and assumed that, if anything, my first try would just help prepare me for what specifically to study more before retaking (because with only 15 questions, how would ML \"in general\" be covered?) Needless to say I was shocked at how basic the assessment was (and also how poorly it represented ML concepts). The vast majority of the questions I got addressed the bias-variance tradeoff... and there were a couple of terminology questions if I remember correctly. I don't think you were overly critical at all. I think you gave some great suggestions on alternative approaches that would help tech people better showcase their skills and I'd love to see LinkedIn implement some of your ideas!\n",
      "214 I really like this video as I'm a student transitioning to data science from civil engineering and even their assessments on other software are more so to identify where things are (interface-wise) rather than applications. I guess LinkedIn could partner up with software&database companies to create courses/challenges that are part of the application process. I personally enjoyed the MATLAB machine learning on-ramp and would like to hear your thoughts on it!\n",
      "215 Ultimately the two factors are: the quality of the assessment and how well particular assessments are trusted and utilized by companies. (A third might be whether a particular assessment is relevant to a particular job. Evaluating someone for a starting position versus a senior position are two slightly different things.) Google's own assessments might be fine for evaluating potential candidates for themselves or possibly other FAANG (. . . . or should that now be MAANG?) company, but is the level of expectations and requirements the same across the board for any company? Assessments, certifications, diplomas, work experience, etc all have as much or as little weight on a resume as a particular recruiter / hiring manager applies to them.\n",
      "216 Ken, if you've got to kiss Linkedin's ass on their crappier aspects to be a Top Voice, then we're both screwed... \n",
      "217 LinedIn will never hire anyone based on such assessments. I guarantee if you create a fake name, resume, take the assessment and then apply to LinkedIn for a machine learning engineer position with the company. Report on the outcome, Ken.\n",
      "218 Happy New Years Ken, first I had not heard of it, maybe I am reading this wrong, I have put considerable time into learning Data Science, which takes years not a few questions. I still am not where I want to be, but at least I know where I am going. You want to people to know your stuff then participate in Kaggle. Like you I like LinkedIn, but they really can do better.\n",
      "219 I think overall, the assessments may not necessarily be a solid indicator because I could just have a second screen to google ASAP. Haha I did that for a few. Also true it would be great if you can endorse AND comment to showcase why or how someone has used a given skill.\n",
      "220 I havent taken any Linkedin assessments exactly because of this reason\n",
      "221 I feel its cuz YouTube data community is growing and every other day, it seem as thou theres more new people then not. Feels like by the time I grad in 5years, not much of the pie would be left for newbies?\n",
      "222 Hi Ken, how are you? Hope fine. So, I am returning to college this year. I am going back to computer science. I am studying Java because of that. And because I was struggling to learn python, my godness! I try every possible way, then I turn out to python official documentation. I achieve a more cleary glimpse of what is python, but nothing too much practical. I found a guy, corey schaffer, he is really didatic. My goal, for this month, is start a small data science project for a local market here where I live. I already have SQL, MySQL, AWS basics and a solid background in maths and stathistics. I think i can do it. If don't, the lesson will be learned. You know. So, thank you for your advice.\n",
      "223 You are 100% correct Ken. From a this kind of assessment taking there is no value for a data science learner to improve his/her skills and no value for recruiters as well. As a learner I tried that test and only had a small enjoyment for publishing and completing some task related to data science. For true skills development or recruiting processes it doesn't give any value. \n",
      "224 Yes, I was initially impacted by these free certification... It's a bad trap in these days... We must instantly get out of it and must empower ourselves with recognising the resources which are really valuable to learn.\n",
      "225 I don't think I like *any* of the LinkedIn badges... I agree fully\n",
      "226 Appreciate the honest feedback Ken!\n",
      "227 You might have lost your chance to be selected as Top LinkedIn Voice for 2021, but you have something infinitesimally better and more important, integrity. #theworldneedslesssellouts.\n",
      "228 I am commenting again because idk where my comment went so when I first gave the ML test I passed it with flying colors but then my friend told me about this github repo that has all the answers to different linkedin assessments which made me kind of sad because that meant the assessment isn't worth much lol\n",
      "229 Thanks. I'm not even going to try LinkedIn learning\n",
      "230 I agree with you Ken. I haven't heard about it before and surely wasn't expecting this from LinkedIn. They should be checking practical knowledge of people considering the type of platform it is. Really poor from their side.\n",
      "231 I love LinkedIn also and really enjoyed your constructive feedbacks. I agree that the ML assessment is really superficial and does not critically assess one's ML skill sets.\n",
      "232 Do employers even care about these \"assessments\"? They don't even care about MOOC's which take up a lot more time and effort. A lot of the places I applied to made me do shitty assessments like these. One tested me on super niche Python features like wtf.\n",
      "233 I did the R assessment a while back. The questions were not very relevant to my experience. It might be better now.\n",
      "234 Took it and got the badge\n",
      "235 LinkedIn has been game changer for many people and also me but I agree that linkedin has pros and cons and i think there assesment is not something we should relive on . And I totally agree with Ken that badges and Certificate won't get you job \n",
      "236 Ken sensei restoring my self-esteem after closing the R assessment halfway Haha .. If it wasn't titled R assessment I wouldn't have known it was for R lol\n",
      "237 I have taken the python and Machine learning assessment and passed it both. But I don't think it is kind of up to the mark assessment of skills. May be we can named it test flight rather than actual assessment.\n",
      "238 It's just not data science assessment, all other assessments are same.\n",
      "239 Spot on !\n",
      "240 I took it. I passed it. I passed a bunch of other assessments. The Python one for example and they're all pretty bad.\n",
      "241 You earned new subscriber. Love your encouragement for people like me. I did installed Python last year but stuck on where to start cuz I dunno what specific purpose. Since I wanna do my PhD related to AI (predictive model), should I learn the whole coding of python or only focus related to AI coding?\n",
      "242 Ive taken the assessment and got the badge. I think ita rubbish! I dont think employers even look at this!\n",
      "243 Terminology is pretty silly I feel like. Business Value > Everything\n",
      "244 LinkedIn is so great at some things and so bad at other things.\n",
      "245 First like \n",
      "246 I don't know whether data science is for me or as non tech person but I want to spend some time to explore to let it know.\n",
      "247 Few days back started exploring data science and today YouTube randomly suggested me your video. Already loving this channel.\n",
      "248 As I learnt python. I was working on projects from kaggle with a problem Statement. I was searching different data exploration techniques. You explained it clearly I love the way you teach. I am following you learning strategie. Thank you\n",
      "249 Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know how you feel about this assessment below? Was I overly critical?\n",
      "250 That video actually came in a good time cause I'm really burning out im my first solo project. Even though I'm not in such a bad position, made a lot of courses and I wrote my first \"import pandas as pd\" five weeks ago I always feel like I'm having a slower progress than I should. I'll take it easy with myself and start with smaller jobs\n",
      "251 Good video.\n",
      "252 Thanks Ken, I took off with python basis last two years, within the space of 2 months, I was already in Pandas, and doing the Jupyter thing. Anyways everything poured on my face, and I just gave up. With this video I saw my mistakes. Roadmap. Starting with the basis and mastering them. Then you proceed. Spend as much time as you want to learn the basis. When your is strong, your building will last forever. Thanks again Ken. \n",
      "253 Hi, your paid link does not work!\n",
      "254 Hi Ken, For the 365 Data science website you recommend, is there any certification given after completion of the course? Also is the certificate recognized?\n",
      "255 One thing I appreciate about your videos is how you tell us about the challenges we will face as beginners but give us the assurance of overcoming these challenges. Thanks for this video. It means a lot to me.\n",
      "256 I really appreciate the advices! ;-]\n",
      "257 Hi Ken! This is AWESOME - I've been a Data Scientist for a few years now and completely agree about constantly needing to learn and refresh the data science toolkit. I didn't start out working on ML models but my work led there over time and had to learn on the job. Just joined the #66DaysOfData challenge and discord for Day 1, really excited to dedicate time to explore the field more. Thanks so much!\n",
      "258 Eligible for entry level job\n",
      "259 Hi, What about SQL before Python?\n",
      "260 how often do you write your models from scratch instead of using library imports?\n",
      "261 Hey Ken! Thanks for the vid, man! Looking forward to beginning my Data Science Journey in 2022! You'll be seeing me throughout the year.\n",
      "262 Lovely learning map, Ken ! And yes 4:30 math is very important ^^ Love your channel and your content, keep it up.\n",
      "263 The panda pics were very satisfying\n",
      "264 sweet and straight forward. better than 10000 useless videos that is literally just wasting time\n",
      "265 Hey everyone, I just uploaded my first ever video, which is a Day in the Life of a Computer Science student. Please check it out when you get a chance. I'll be posting content regularly going forward. Hopefully it's beneficial to anyone who is currently a CS student, a prospective CS student who is looking for insight, or others who just want to see some more CS content. Learn from my mistakes and let's learn together along the way https://youtu.be/izKFglRZKYE Ken, your video is super informative! Thanks for the pointers. I'm think I'm headed towards the data science route, so this was very helpful and I look forward to watching your other vids and future content. :)\n",
      "266 Helping the algo.\n",
      "267 Boss Ken.. 6months on the go... I consider I'm a good learning path. I'm starting with statistics (19hrs tutorial video), then I will take up math to Excel/python... Thank you for this\n",
      "268 I'm a Business Intelligence analyst working on Tableau. And would like to explore python for data science. Any inputs for getting started?\n",
      "269 Hello Ken Jee. Thank you for all the amazing content you always put out. I need help deciding on a budget laptop (used or new) to buy as I have just my started learning. I need something that will be sufficient for the next 1-2yrs of learning/projects till I get a job in the DS field and can afford another. I am looking to purchase one within a month.\n",
      "270 This is much needed video. As in most of the cases beginner spend alot of time learning math rather than doing data science. This video can clarify one confusion they data science is not a math field but just need some knowledge of mathematics.\n",
      "271 Hi, I'm a uni student majoring in business analytics. Because my school doesn't have a program that is \"data analytic\". If I only have two years left of college life. Is it possible to enter the data field? Btw, I like this video.\n",
      "272 This is a great video. Thank you. I needed it.\n",
      "273 This is awesome! Excited to start!\n",
      "274 The secret is already no more a secret \n",
      "275 Already got my first book recommendation for 2022.\n",
      "276 Recently bought a machine with 6gb rtx 2060 gpu. Excited to work on it.\n",
      "277 The most confusing topic for most of the beginner. Well explained.\n",
      "278 The tip is to just dive into this journey without too much thinking. You will definitely find a way as you start exploring this vast field.\n",
      "279 My cooking and Data science analogy is : The more you cook the more better Chef you become, similarly the more project you build the better data scientist you will be.\n",
      "280 The best thing I learn from personal experience is that the journey of learning data science become much more easy if you follow less number of data established data scientist as an online mentor. The less the better. I personally follow this channel and it helps me Alot in my journey.\n",
      "281 I believe data science is for a person who has life long learning attitude. As Data science is fast evolving field and it requires you to have daily learning attitude.\n",
      "282 Watching two years old video of yours got me noticed one thing that you improved amazingly in both video quality and the way you explain stuff.\n",
      "283 a job simp ? eh\n",
      "284 How long will the 365 discount last? IS it only for the holiday or is it like a affiliate/code thing?\n",
      "285 R for production ?\n",
      "286 I think everyone should talk about how they learn and everyone should aim to get better at learning. Very helpful thanks\n",
      "287 Been waiting for this video!!!! To anyone reading this, if you're looking to break into Data Science in 2022 I 100% recommend subscribing to Ken's channel and following his advice!! Back when COVID-19 started in 2020, I was looking to break into the field and I had no experience, no projects, and I didn't know where to start. 6 MONTHS after subscribing to Ken's channel and soaking in all of his advice through his videos, I got a job as a Data analyst. I'm living proof that this channel is 100% all that you need to get started. Thank you Ken and & I can't thank you enough for the doors you have opened for me.\n",
      "288 The only question I got is do we need a traditional degree to get in that domain? I'm a finance grad. Idk if I'd be eligible for a masters program in data science so how do I do it? Cause I don't think employers recognise anything other than degrees.\n",
      "289 This sounds more like supervised and unsupervised learning, rather than data science\n",
      "290 Do you need a masters degree?? Cos it seems a lot of people are running to data science and AI masters programs\n",
      "291 Literally hit it on the nail for me. Combining BI tools on Windows and my Data Science work on Linux will be huge for me!\n",
      "292 Congrats Ken!!! I loved this video! Especially the roadmap on how to learn Data Science \n",
      "293 It's that time of year again....\"If I had to start over\" videos are coming\n",
      "294 lol is the mask overlay a joke? i hope it is\n",
      "295 let's just hope this isn't just another diversity hire, happens too often these days\n",
      "296 Ken,i really lack from the maths side of things,what books/ressources do you recommand ?\n",
      "297 I have been reading a lot about investments and budgeting for the past couple years. A book that really made an impact on me is \"The Millionaire Next Door\" by Thomas Stanley. One of the most important concepts that stuck with me is understanding and balancing your offense and defense with money. \"Offense\" means controlling how much money you make - which you often have less control over. And \"defense\", which is how you spend money which is more controllable. It is pretty data heavy...which you might like as a data scientist.\n",
      "298 when you realize 2022 is pronounced as \"2020 too\"\n",
      "299 Thanks, Ken. I have started learning myself Data Science, fortunately, I have a programming/math background. and so far I have found the going reasonable all though it is an effort in time. My question is this is there a place for a part-time / freelance Data Scientist? I find the field extremely interesting but I doubt if that is all I want to do. Also, do you know if c++ is still used in Data Science? Kind regards\n",
      "300 Watched just right now, but worth it. I want to entry in data science because I like to solve problems driven by data. I like to see the variables of a problem in the reality and reach a solution; solve real-world problems. This is something that I couldn't do with enginnering; college was a really frustation. But there I heard of 'data science' for the very first time and learn stathistics. I trying to enter in this field in a self paced manner.

      "301 Great video Ken! I will be sharing with my incoming students this semester!\n",
      "302 hey tech algorithm\n",
      "303 I used your project-based learning approach from last year's video to learn data science. After 15 months and 700 hours of learning (no online courses, just individual studying), I landed as job as a mid-level data scientist in financial fraud detection. Thank you! This video is spot-on. Especially your emphasis of building a roadmap and systematically updating it as you grow. 2 not-obvious study habits which I found helpful: 1. I kept multiple projects open so that after I went through a topic (e.g. feature selection), I could implement it in multiple projects. 2. For each topic in my roadmap, I kept a date of when I last implemented the technique in a project. This helped me identify important topics which I had covered a while ago and might have partially forgotten, so that I could refresh my knowledge/skills.\n",
      "304 Hi how can we deploy this as a webapp on heroku? waiting for your reply please :(\n",
      "305 What should we know before we start these projects?\n",
      "306 Hi Ken, is a data scientist a software programmer? How to improve one's programming skills if one has had limited exposure or does not feel too confident about programming?\n",
      "307 How hard is it to get job without master's degree??\n",
      "308 I had one question in regards with DS that is, is 2022 the best time to move into it especially since its been a \"hyped\" job for about past 3-4 years won't there be a high barrier to entry ?\n",
      "309 What are your thoughts about the IBM and Google Data Science Certificates - good if you can afford it?\n",
      "310 Thanks for the recommendations Ken! I am always updating my learning path to include new things or based in things I enjoyed the most, for example making a deeper dive in data visualization. What happened with the editing? There is a frame mirrowed in minute 5:52. Your desk is in the other side of the room. Thanks again for the amazing content!\n",
      "311 can you make a video about new techniques you learned this year? there arent really resources on i guess \"advanced\" data science\n",
      "312 by the way, most data science college courses are fucking awful. take them for the credibility, but use Kaggle Learn and personal projects to actually learn things\n",
      "313 really liked your work, we need more people like you. keep it up man!!\n",
      "314 Data science is a vast field and as ken said if we consider learning data science process as a journey we will enjoy the whole process rather than getting overwhelmed by it. 1) Set goal for your self (I want to get good understanding of deep learning) 2) Stick to it. 3) Do as many projects as you want. 4) Showcase your project so that world know what you are doing (you should be open for any kind of criticism or feedback) 5) Repeat step number 3 for the rest of the 2022.\n",
      "315 \"Data science is a journey not a destination\". Love this line.\n",

      "318 Ive been waiting all year for this! Solid advice Ken!\n",
      "319 hey ken! i'm a freshman double majoring in cs and stats - also pursuing a data science-related career. just thought you should know that i as a college student find your channel extremely insightful and valuable. wishing the best for you and your content coming into 2022 :>\n",
      "320 My goals this year is to complete the 365 data science course, I have been doing it since past couple of weeks, so I have gained the momentum, now just need to be consistent. Apart from that, I will try to do as many projects as I can and start freelancing in late 2022\n",

      "325 I started using WSL since the last 5 months, it's really handy!\n",
      "326 I wonder if ken changed his mic recently, his voice is.. how do I describe it?.. more satisfying? Ken ASMR when?\n",
      "327 All of them are such great advice. Thanks for the inspiring ideas. Furthermore, I completely agree with you about data science is a journey.\n",
      "328 Hey Ken why don't you join youtube as developer and do coding. Make that link box appear on left side so you don't have to mirror your video.XD\n",
      "329 Thank you so much!\n",
      "330 Hey Ken. What do you think about the Open Source Society University's self taught data science curriculum? I'm just starting my Junior year in college and wanted to start learning data science.\n",
      "331 Very Super Nice video .. Big thanks Champ \n",
      "332 Speaking of goals, it would be cool to see a TOP Goals video, etc.\n",
      "333 Congrats and thanks Ken! Happy new year to you, as much like you made my last year. You are helping people man, keep the vibe! Respect from Brazil! :D\n",
      "334 If I were relearn data science in 2022, I'd start by subscribing to your channel haha but in practicality it is: 1. Coursework 2. Projects 3. Teach Also great motivational video for simple content creation during break!\n",
      "335 Really love how it will add up to previous video on this topic \n",
      "336 Great advice on typing out other people's work. Myself as a beginner it's easy to get flustered on projects as some solutions/tools I have not yet been exposed to. By looking up other's solutions/work and typing them out it really helps me to understand the anatomy of the code. Furthermore, sometimes the solutions don't work as I am using python 3.10 and so I have to work out and start fishing around for the latest 'iteration' of the module/code and that actually helps to drive home the knowledge.\n",
      "337 Thanks for the insights ken, do you think cloud computing skills (AWS, azure etc..) is necessary for the data science journey.\n",
      "338 Excelente video Ken. Yo llevo 9 meses aprendiendo ciencia de datos y es una profesin increble. Me siento muy feliz de haber aprendido sobre esto. El prximo ao mi meta es tener un nivel B1 de ingles y usare tus videos para lograrlo. Muchas gracias!\n",
      "339 Ken, what I have found is all these online projects / learnings mostly gives 10 variables and ask to predict a 11th one. But in the real world its very difficult to goto that level of identifying a problem and later identifying a approach to solver a problem . Until now I have not seen any course teaching that. Your advice on this ?\n",
      "340 Do you have a Udemy course?\n",
      "341 Thanks a lot, some of us have only just started using python properly the last few months and videos like this are very useful\n",
      "342 \"When beginning with this projects, they don't have to be original. You can go through the exact same analysis that someone else did, and still learn something. But typical learning session could just be you having someone else's project on half the screen and you typing it line-by-line and running it on other half of the screen. As you do this you can change the parameters, you can experiment with different visuals and see how it works as you go.\" This one what i've been thinking for. i feel like i do nothing if i see someone's project and copy it to my notebook, but you just said it and i totally agree. we can experiment it with changing the code, maybe we use a different way to clean the data, or just define a function that others use repeated code, (a.k.a use DRY concept), and so on. thanks Ken Jee, it really helps me out.\n",
      "343 Awesome!! This is really helpful. Thanks\n",
      "344 Let's accept KEN is the BEST \n",
      "345 This updated video is epic. Your pioneering \"If I had to start over\" video had inspired so many similarly named videos in the tech youtube space. Certainly agree with you on the importance of coding and how that opened up several doors of opportunities in accessing \"power tools\" for the data science learning journey. 8:01 Also thanks for the mention \n",
      "346 Excellent video to watch at 5am!\n",
      "347 I agree it takes up to a year to get the fundamentals. Then you basically never stop learning.\n",

      "351 Booting process is sometimes very boring... This is a best way \n",
      "352 Can we say it as a biggest machine learning model failure ? Idea is definitely good. I also think that whenever a big company buy something people expect good amount which may sometimes overestimated... Also fixing old house is more trouble than building new one...\n",
      "353 Watching this in preparation for actually reading a book next year. Great video Ken!\n",
      "354 (Reminder that all resources I mentioned are linked in the description!) Thanks for watching everyone! Let me know what your goals for this year are below! Mine Are: - Do a project with a Generative Adversarial Neural Net - Enter at least 1 Kaggle Competition - Do at least 4 projects and share them on YouTube\n",
      "355 Hello, This is a late comment but I was wondering if someone has the same issue. I followed the same steps to add images to my portfolio, but they are not being updated. They show on the actual github page, but it does not show on my html link (12 hours have passed) Any idea why this is happening? Thank you!\n",
      "356 content is ok. poorly done editing imo\n",

      "358 If I had to choose between data science and cloud computing what should I choose ? Plz answer me\n",
      "359 First project can never be a perfect piece. The most important thing is to take start rather than thinking about the level of outcomes.\n",
      "360 thank you for sharing your journey. It's super helpful for a c straight student in statistics like me. I've given up several time yet run to it again and again through my work\n",
      "361 No-code really is just a new buzzword that means what \"democratization\" used to mean. It lets unskilled people do what we do so we can learn the new hotness in our field. I used to be a web analyst. When Google Analytics started interpreting itself, I moved on to software skills and ML skills. No-code is good. As soon as we get comfortable with techniques, they are no longer cutting edge. So they're boring. No-code offloads that shit to our stakeholders so we can move on to the new cool stuff.\n",

We set up data warehouses and develop Power BI dashboards for many customers in a big variety of industries (cosmetic, food, electronic, medicine, clinic, hotel, aquaculture., etc.) The business is pretty good. Some of them have started using machine learning for prediction. So I think that data science is trending upward.\n",

I really don't understand why people would ask if data science is a dying trend/industry/discipline etc. With more data becoming available and languages/tools like Python and R getting regular updates, there will always be a need for those skills and I personally don't see any of this becoming obsolete. I can see why data science as a title might render it declining trend but I wouldn't focus so much on what constitutes data science. Also you need to keep making content so this discipline cannot die!!!\n",

      "464 What everyone including companies themselves fail to understand is that when they are asking for data scientists, and ML engineers, they are really wanting to be disrupting their own business before someone else does it for them. AI and data science are just strongly associated with digital disruption. When viewed through this lens, data professionals will be needed but the work they do and technologies they use will evolve. The role of digital disruption by making use of data through whatever technology is available is what people should focus on to remain relevant.\n",

      "472 Hi\n",
      "473 My first rule of ML Engineering is that you need to spend a lot of time on two sides of Feature Engineering: The input side that creates your state, and the output side that needs to accept it to create that future state. If they would have spend more time in estimating not just the prior stage in the value chain but also the next stage, they might not have ended up in this situation. I.e. if they would have spend as much time to understand the behavior of real estate agents for example, they could have discovered that there are many cases in which they should have created a portal in which only professional real estate agents have access to that database first and can take that estimate as a suggestion and continue the process; revealing how the discrepancies come to be. This way you could get expert input from crucial parts of the value chain in front of you, ride the value chain instead of trying to compete with it. In empirical science people often underestimate the impact of qualitative data compared to quantitative data. And that is exactly what happened here. My 2ct.\n",

      "502 Isn't the biggest issue that the transaction dynamic here is set up in a way to maximize the impact of any mistakes in the buyers favor and minimize the impacts of mistakes in Zillows favor? In other words, even if the Zestimate was 99% accurate in its offer prices, the incentive for a buyer to accept an \"accurate\" offer is much less than their incentive to accept an overpriced offer, so the impact of the 1% inaccuracy is destined to be magnified.\n",

      "520 Hey Ken, thanks for touching on some issues which were glaring a problem. But just to emphasis, flipping a property to a potential buyer at a current market rate may not have been a \"good\" choice, as current market value does not include in the renewal cost the company incurred for the house. You also did mention the model should adjust with a volatile market - VERY TRUE ! but this does not mean Zillow should have sold properties at a lower price, when the market is down to show that real-estate business is still thriving. This could have created a property-bubble. So their idea just backfired thinking that selling properties could spark more buying ...this market is dynamic on the back of demand and NOT supply. \"Hey the pictures look good of the houses on sale, but I would still go there and see the property myself. \" As you said in the section \"What is the zestimate really ?\" they should have had professional opinion to get a good grip of what the house-price should be. I think the business model was to eliminate such an intermediary, so that the \"negotiation\" is downed. Thank you for this video Ken, because I'm an aspiring ML engineer and trying to become a Data Scientist; however I want to use these skills into actual business and this video has given me an insight... How to succeed in a business using ML/DL as tools that compliments my other skills. Maybe become a real-estate developer who has Data Science and ML skills and not just a General ML or DS pro. Cheers\n",

That article you displayed, \"this will make you understand how hard data science really is\", is trapped by that fallacy: you can only be really really good at something if you know all the stuff about it. That's a very academic mindset and I found that in the real world outside college, it's not what you know, it's how well you can solve problems (aka finish projects). You don't need to know things from the top of your head if you have learned how to find and process information fast. If I had known that in university I probably would've been a lot happier and relaxed about my future.\n",

In essence, companies will always look for data scientists but not to depend on them solely but rather to use them as a helping tool for core veterans of companies. Nobody in right mind will change a product price solely based on a data model. So yes, the demand for data scientists will eventually slow down.\n",

I was myself blinded by the hype around Data Science, not knowing that without serious Data Engineering skills (to extract, transform/clean, load and most importantly, to understand the journey of) data, all the effort of fine tuning ML models could be nullified by the poor quality of data.\n",

      "602 As for AutoAI/AI GUI I been using one given by my company but the performance has only been surpar. I am using it more as a pipeline designer so less technical coworkers who are not comfortable with code can use it. On the other hand, fine tuning pretrained model has much better results and I think models trained by big tech companies will dominant in the next 5 years. I also agree with your point with data engineering as I have spent a lot of time in this area. So my 2 cents is Transfer learning tuning w/ preprocessing > AutoAI. My data will eventually output to some low code/no code applications, but I don't see how those application will replace software engineers/developers. I hope this is the same situation for us data scientist.\n",
      "603 I think part of it is the pressure for the next content piece. There are only so many do data science posts/videos you can do before saturation.

      "606 Based on my experience on the job market, Data Engineering is competitive right now, but it's easier to find a place that is willing to train you on it compared to Data Science. I was an analyst for almost 3 years doing a lot of programming and just got a job as a Data Engineer. I was upfront about my relative lack of experience but showed them all the ways I have worked on bridging that gap, and they are willing to train me.

Right now I'm working on a project that involves integrating data from multiple sources for other people to use, which is very similar to data engineering, but my goal is to be on the data analysis side and I'm hoping that in the future projects around that will arise. With that being said do you thing that doing this kind of work will pay off in the future, or should I be doing data analysis and data science instead? P.S. I have less than 6 months experience in the field so far. Thanks!\n",
      "618 By 2030, data science as we know it won't exist. The demand for DS will be much smaller after transformational automation is complete. A large percentage of roles will fall back to traditional analytical functions such as accounting and finance and the smaller data science function will be the sole preserve of the Ph.D. who will maintain high salary levels but the rest of the data science fodder will have to look elsewhere for large paydays. Right now the value that can be delivered by DS is very high but this will become marginal over time so $130K+ starting salaries for DS roles will become a thing of the past for all except the cream of the Ph.D. crop.\n",
      "619 Im fairly new to data engineering, but Im beginning to notice that there are some segments in Data Engineering approaches to solutions - custom code, implementation of tools, and a hybrid approach each with their own pros and cons. Custom code can be a good solution when there isnt an out-of-the-box solution, the job is small, but this can take time. Prebuilt tools can get problems solved quickly, but may lack some functionality/features and can be expensive. The hybrid approach seems to be the most useful, but it takes a lot of knowledge to know how, where, and when to make these decisions for a business solution.\n",
      "620 A career as a data engineer likely appeals to people, like myself, who enjoy building stuff that endures over time.\n",
      "621 This video definitely triggered my jealousy by looking at your pizza making flex Well as they say, many people just go on for the sophisticated stuff without even clearing the base. I think same is the scenario with data. Many companies joined the data science hype but didn't pay attention to their data or it's architecture. So now as a damage control move, they're back to sorting out their basics and now we need data engineers. I was waiting for this topic to be touched and finally you did!! \n",
      "622 Would you consider a career in data engineering? Let me know in the comments below! Thanks for watching everyone! For anyone wondering... Yes, I did make this entire video just so I could use the zoolander clip at the beginning.\n",
      "623 Hey, do we need to install anaconda or is just spyder okay?\n",
      "624 Data science is big but being able to interpret and provide insights from the data is where the money is. Lots of people can pull data and code using R, python etc..but if you can't explain how to use that results for predictive forecast or explaining how it either proves or disapproves your initial hypothesis then data analytics does not add any value.\n",
      "625 awesome video!! I'll definitely try the speed reader and read the book recommendations!\n",
      "626 I have a great mindset for data, however I never code with Python, who can help me basic of Python language!\n",
      "627 Those who think Data Science is dying are actually the ones who are overcome by self-doubt before even starting to actually try and get on the learning curve. So they spout such baseless statements to appease themselves and justify their unwillingness to learn such a fascinating field.\n",
      "628 I am sure data science is not dying but the way we did data science today might be different in future.\n",
      "629 Thanks\n",

      "631 I am 35 years old am I too late then?\n",
      "632 Hello Ken have to agree with you, and as trends or tools change, your already one step ahead in learning whatever comes along. Data Analyst is a good starting point but not end all. The more tools you have the better your chances of advancing. That is my two bits. Have a wonderful holiday\n",
      "633 Hey Ken, your video is such a bliss as always. I am working as System Analyst aged 41 years. Can I learn Data Science at this age and start my career in it? What advice you have for me?\n",
      "634 True data scientist would go and check statistics :d\n",
      "635 i literally just got some clarity in this subject and people are saying its dying come on!!!\n",
      "636 hi Ken great video, i have one question i am planning to change my career and i have study gap of 10 years i am working in immigration department, so my intend is to do masters from UK in data science and i still have more then a year to apply for so i am thinking to learn basics like python and other language to see if that is my thing however what would you suggest would that be a good decision?\n",
      "637 Atomic Habits: Just start with one push up a day... David Goggins: Excuse me???\n",

      "640 I saw you comment on other channels, thinking you're some annoying spam, but i actually became a fan, i love your content, keep it up!\n",
      "641 Thanx for the help bro \n",
      "642 How can data science die if it's always been there? Everything we do is based on the data we collect, and that will continue to happen. People don't know what they don't know.\n",
      "643 FYI in Israel there's a very very big demand for data scientists and a very short supply\n",

      "649 I hate lambda functions because they're so sexy. I'm trying to keep myself sexually attracted to human beings and not to Computer code. I feel that one elegantly written subroutine in Python is all that's necessary to push me over the edge and make me completely gay for code.\n",
      "650 I think entry level roles for data science are getting pretty saturated and competitive. This might create the impression of less demand for some people. However the value of a veteran data scientist is hard to overstate.\n",
      "651 instead of dropping an \"Unnamed: 0\" column, we can pass the \"index_col = 0\" argument in the first place when we define the df variable as our dataFrame variable. maybe looks like this df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv', index_col=0) the documentation says \"index_col=False can be used to force pandas to not use the first column as the index,\" correct me if i'm wrong. hey by the way, what a nice playlist, i enjoyed it. thanks ken, big thumbs up\n",
      "652 But is it too late to become a data science YouTube influencer???\n",
      "653 I hope not, I just enrolled in a Masters in DS ha\n",
      "654 Excellent analysis Ken. I admire your effort to reduce bias (and maybe increase variance).\n",
      "655 As a beginner, I'm extremely thankful for you. Your videos are super informative.\n",
      "656 Just recently started my first role as a data analyst/consultant for a property consultancy, people in other teams and companies have told me about the struggle they are having finding data analysts. I'm from the UK so this may of course differ where you are living but its clear new companies are realising how imporant data is.\n",
      "657 I always think that data science and analyst job will be replaced by AI. It is not that hard. The future is about human interactions. All human capabilities can be performed (even better) by computers. I also read many articles about this and, the truth is yes, the future jobs will be the ones which requires cognitive, psycology and sense of human beings.\n",
      "658 Why the hell would it die\n",
      "659 Do you think someone going through college whose interested in data science be better off majoring in computer science or data science?\n",
      "660 No Data science is a teeneager... It will not die as early as some ppl are thinking... Live long data science...\n",
      "661 As a student in Data Science, in order to automate those tasks, AI needs to be much more advanced in order to actually do it so its still pretty far off.\n",
      "662 Thanks, Ken, for the great insights. I don't see data science dying but just continuously evolving. It better not be too late to start your data science career because I'm probably going to set the age record for getting started! Thank you so much for the way you keep me challenged to continue growing. BTW, I took your recommendation to get Aurelien Geron's ML book because I needed another resource to bolster my green ML skills. Great find!\n",
      "663 The sentiment is maybe coming from the difficulties to find your fist job if you are an aspiring data scientist. Rejection and unclear expectations (most companies have no idea how to find and sort data-scientists) may make many believe that is was just a fad, and they came a little late to the party.\n",
      "664 Ken Jee hit the nail on the head perfectly. The general public, major business and especially the media have little to no understanding what data science and diversity of roles in this field. Since the field is much newer than others, how would anyone who communicates about value it or hold it in regard to any other white collar job? So when people want to move on to write about the next hot topic trend, or lack understanding of the subjects projected growth, its just easier to say it is dying.\n",
      "665 Is death dying ?\n",
      "666 Thank you very much for your explanation. I think it can be helpful to have groups of 3 to 5 persons in which you can work together on projects. In this way, you can learn from others and have the motivation\n",
      "667 Ken guess it is little hard to try out different roles Most of the companies looking for \"experieced in the title\" roles. Even if for example, I would be a great product owner or product manager, sisnce my title is system engineer, when HR sees that title, they say nahh, we need \"in title experience\" individual. I guess If someone can swith role, it is also \" guess\" chance factor is really important.\n",

      "669 I saw GPT3 and thought, welp, most software engineering jobs are going to get booted. Tell me if Im wrong. And also if this could spillover to data science.\n",
      "670 There is a problem with those statistics. If data scientist jobs grow from 1000 to 10000 that's nothing really even if it has a huuuuuge percentage in increase. Plus, you are almost DEAD if you look for an entry level position.\n",
      "671 Very solid arguments. Even though the title might change, the skill sets will definitely always be in demand.\n",
      "672 I also think causal inference will be more popular in the future of data science which is more difficult to automate than prediction as it requires more interpretability\n",
      "673 Greetings Ken Jee! What should we do when finding conflicts between packages version in anaconda-venv? Thnx ..\n",
      "674 Let's cut the crap: the only reason people write articles saying data science is dying is to be edgy and get clicks.\n",
      "675 I think companies are realizing they need data engineers more than data scientists. I see 4 data engineers for every 1 data scientists. I also see a lot of overlap between data scientists and analysts, yet one gets paid significantly more for having a fancy title, but cant write basic sql lol. Why not just have ML Engineer, Software Engineer, and Analyst all under Data Operations or Data Analytics and Engineering? The need for all these titles are annoying and unnecessary.\n",
      "676 Always a great video master master Ken! I think with Alteryx a lot of people feel a lot of these jobs are being automated and everyone can run a model. But I found many of people who just run these workflows can't really explain the results when you ask detailed questions. There's always going be work for some cookie cutter projects but there will always be room for when you need to innovate and a cookie cutter approach won't be the best solution. Totally agree with your analysis! Keep up the great work! Happy early ThanksGiving!\n",

      "686 I really like you Ken, but educational content that's I want... Instead of getting uncertain topics like thisss\n",
      "687 Im starting to learn data science with a mind towards still being employable in 2050. No matter whether the job of data scientist is around then, the skills learned in the job will be invaluable. Analysis, data architecture, machine learning, data visualization, Python and R, all of these skills will allow data scientists to be on the cutting edge of any new tools developed between then and now. And big data is getting bigger by the second. Barring some kind of AGI singularity, data science should continue on an upward trend. Thanks Ken for all the help in your videos so far, and for confirming my hunch that the field is going strong.\n",
      "688 The Data Wiz has spoken ..Now that's clear \" Data Science isn't Dying\" Totally agree with your point ken where you mentioned that when companies and people would be able to understand the difference between different data roles , these questions wouldn't be coming again n again ... Also i feel you should title your videos as Data Myth Buster by ken :)\n",
      "689 to the moon, diamond hands\n",
      "690 Great insights as always Ken! The data science umbrella is so large, that several \"titles\" will be more defined by companies to find the person with the skill set required to solve their problems.\n",

      "692 You seem to be encouraging me. Can you guide me ? I am above 50 years old - I have Master degrees in Business Administration and Statistics . I have also done programming at the initial stage of my career and had been working in the ICT area. Recently I have acquired knowledge of ML with Python. I wonder why I didnt think about being a data scientist earlier ! Anyway I want to be one one now - almost at the fang end of my career.. I have worked in the Middle East and India and in the UK for only 1 year after MBA. I am a very fast learner . Can anyone help me in getting data scientist or analyst or business analyst job anywhere in the world? I know my age maybe a negative point but then I have vast experience of working in different business area.\n",
      "693 When I was 12 years old, I wanted to learn HTML and JavaScript to build my own website that had guitars and penguins on it. All the so-called \"smart\" \"adults\" around me said that programming was a waste of time because all the programming jobs would get outsourced to other countries anyways and that programming was too hard for people who weren't good at math (like me). Not knowing anything, I decided to listen to them. Fast forward 4-14 years later, there are self-taught programmers who don't know much math and never went to college, who are now making high 6 figures and I missed that opportunity because I listened too much to other people when I was 12. Don't listen to people who aren't experts in the field you are exploring. Data science today is what HTML and web development was in 1997. It's not that new but it is still growing fast enough and there's plenty of room for more data scientists and computer programmers.\n",
      "694 I think easy entry to data science is dying however skilled data science entry is increasing in demand. The main barrier is how many are going to squeeze every neuron in their brain to truly work to their potential and capacity to be skilled and make value in this field.\n",
      "695 @3:50, yes, Web Developers are still in high demand, but today their pay rate and demand isn't the same as it was back in the 90's and 00's Wouldn't be surprised if the same happens with Data Analysts / Scientists\n",
      "696 My assumption - no analysis - was that there is a glut of data science boot camp graduates - plus the disconnect I've seen mentioned between people who study things like NLP and image recognition, which are not in demand in the workforce. Probably part of it for me is just that - i dont want to be a data scientist. I'm more interested in data profiling and analysis and modeling. I actually was turned down for a role I didnt realy want - because while the role said 'data analyst' they really wanted a junior data scientist - someone who WANTED to be a data scientist. I stumbled in to a great role, though, I think!\n",
      "697 Great video Ken! Completely agree that data science is on the rise as companies are just realising the full potential \n",
      "698 On the rise. Data never dies. It will grow. How good ai is doing is also a data.\n",
      "699 You sound like ELON MUSK\n",
      "700 Hi ken ! I wanted to ask u this question last time when we discussed the video but I thought Youtube would be better. I am applying for a PhD in the states and considering specializing in NLP. I am also considering working on applied fields like climatology or environmental economics since I come from an econ background, but ofc the algorithms are the same ( no DL there ofc ) .. I just want to get your opinion on that if possible, but ofc don't worry I won't take it as Quran in my case lol ( It means a lot to me tho )\n",
      "701 Great insights. Thank you. Im just a beginner in Data Science and headlines like this pop up every once in a while. \n",
      "702 The lack of focus on data leadership and waste from hype, we're just not seeing a lot of feasible products and services that companies know what to do with or want to pay for. There's significant abrasion between the skills that are professed via Google and what companies actually need done. With that being said, there are a lot of newbies unwilling to make a commitment to the career. When they find out it's not just pushing buttons in Anaconda, they bail. Will data science grow or will companies adapt to what's available in the software and labor market when the hype dies? Or will they just keep throwing money into the unknown?\n",
      "703 I agree!!\n",
      "704 It won't die because nothing truly dies in life. It all just gets recycled or sent to the Lord's Kingdom in Heaven. Just always have faith! Data Science will be in a better place someday\n",
      "705 Thanks Ken ! I am finishing my last year in Industrial Engineering and your videos motivated me to try learning DS as a side hustle. To be honest with you, it seems really overwhelming at first because the field is gigantic and i am trying to keep the pace with my Uni studies and my part time job... all of this at the same time... Currently i am using Dataquest to learn the basics (Python, Matplotlib, Pandas, Numpy, SQL, etc.). but sometimes the motivation hits all time low even though i am in love with this new domain. Do you have some quick and effectif tips with this issue ? Thanks Again.\n",
      "706 Great video Mr.Jee thanks for your sharing your knowledge\n",
      "707 Hi Ken. Read \"How not to die\". That will really make an impact.\n",
      "708 Great video Ken! I definitely see the field trending up from an employer's perspective. Like you said, so many companies that aren't the FAANG companies are just starting to get to grips with the amount of data that they have available to them and will need to hire more and more data scientists as they seek to extract insights from their data.\n",
      "709 As someone who's a relatively new data scientist, thanks for giving me all the confirmation bias that I needed Ken \n",
      "710 Top video, thanks for the quality insight\n",
      "711 Data science is definitely not dying and for the fact it's only scaling much bigger. Companies have started seeing the advantage of using data and data science and organisations are adopting data which is in fact create more demand for data experts .\n",
      "712 Definitely think it on the upwards trend\n",
      "713 The Data Science King has spoken; Data Science is NOT DYING!! Very much agree with this, Ken! I also will add that I feel there is going to be a stronger need for data engineering as we go into the future.\n",
      "714 Long live data scince\n",
      "715 Yea I agree with you totally\n",
      "716 Thanks for the awesome analysis. I think data science is still on the rise. I think because it's a bit hard to get into the industry especially for beginners makes it seem like it's on the decline.\n",
      "717 That's really on point. People see advancements in tech and join the bandwagon of making predictions about the decline of human jobs. I think we have not yet realised that automated solutions would most probably be generic and not user specific. In this field of ever growing competition, users would be looking for more personalized solutions and for that, we would require people.\n",
      "718 This video hit the net at a perfect time for me. Applying now and this gives me the confidence that there are junior DS roles to be filled and not the plethora of senior data science listings I've come across. Thanks Ken \n",
      "719 Hey Ken, love your stuff, what advice would you have for someone whos soon to be graduated with a masters in data science who now only sees anxiety inducing videos like this? what skills could someone like me look to add that are less likely to become automated or phased out?\n",
      "720 Data scientists who have some knowledge of a non-tech domain will be in great demand too. In sports, its advantages are manifold and its usage is on a rise.\n",
      "721 Great insights Ken. I certainly agree that data science's decline is far from sight. In the life science domain, the use of data science has started to scratch the surface and there's a whole new frontier of possibilities.\n",
      "722 I don't think it's gonna die anytime soon. Companies which uses data to grow their business have a significant upper hand on businesses who don't. So, even if the new entrepreneurs don't want to use data, they still will have to use it otherwise they are gonna get beaten easily by their competitor's who are using it. And the fact that people give away their data 24/7 , you need someone to analyse that, so data science is probably on the rise in my opinion, no doubt at all\n",
      "723 Okay, BUT HOW DO YOU FIND PERFECT CLIPS FOR EVERYTHING!\n",
      "724 Good to hear that :)\n",
      "725 Hey Ken, thank you for your insights! Btw, I'm seeing Blockchain developer jobs are on the rise and Blockchain maybe the next big thing. Do you agree? Is there an intersection between the two kinds of jobs (BC and DS) or are they mutually exclusive?\n",

      "729 Hi Ken, I'm currently doing a structural biology PhD. The only experience with python/programming I have is through two things: 1) undergrad research where I was doing in silico drug screening against to protein homologs via programs such autodock followed by molecular dynamics. I had to write a few basic python scripts that made the program I was using (YASARA) run and export these simulations over about 20K small molecules per homolog. Things YASARA didn't have built in. That was 4+ years ago (took a job as a technician in a structural biology lab for about 3 years). Finally got into a PhD program but want to move into the computational side (though not entirely giving up wet-lab/experimental structure determination. I'm currently doing my lab rotations and have become more interested in methods. So for cryo-EM and crystallography using computers to help aid in determining structure, which requires ML/DL. On top of that I'm still interested in molecular dynamics of protein-ligan interactions, etc. Which might not be as influenced by data science. Lastly, I had a short course (about half a semester) that introduced R for bio/strucbio data analysis and plotting. I've been reading a lot of theory (as that's what most professors I'm interested in working with/rotating through seem publish) but still have and am working on my python programming. Any suggestions for this path? How does one balance graduate school with learning a new skill? The PhD route takes up so much time, how does one learn programming to slightly change projectory within their first year of grad school (to be of interest to comp bio/phys PIs but also so that one has enough experience so that they're not embarrassed or feel like they're holding the research back)? That was long winded, but thanks!\n",

These mechanisms are so fundamental to our thinking that even if you are aware of them, you still are prone to making those thinking errors.

      "753 Have you read How Not to Die? That's the book that has had the most profound impact on my life. You talked about how our gut microbiomes affects the way that we respond to individual foods, but you didn't mention the way that what we eat impacts our gut microbiome. Eating meat adversely affects our gut microbiome, and even our gene expression. While there is plenty of room for individualizing dietary patterns to get people to eat food that they are more compatible with, the broad dietary patterns are clear. Eat minimally processed vegetables, fruit, whole grains, legumes, nuts, and seeds, and minimize or eliminate your consumption of animal products, refined sugar, refined fat (oil), and processed foods. While the answer of a plant based diet is incomplete, it is at least moving in the right direction, as compared to keto and carnivore diets, which are both associated with increased all cause mortality and environmental destruction. It wouldn't surprise me that meat is worse for some people than others, but I'm extremely skeptical that it's actively good for anyone. I'll be interested to read what they say in Personalized Diet, but I doubt they can convince me that ice cream is healthy for anyone.\n",

I have been more into data books now a days and trying to understand how data affects business. Currectly reading \"Data Means Business\" and \"Stock market\". What all books are you guys reading currently?\n",

      "762 I REALLY WANTED THIS VIDEO \n",
      "763 interesting, you just spoilered book about food and atomic habits. I do not need to read them anymore \n",
      "764 Thanks for the amazing book recommendations...I'm sure to read Why We Sleep after this...the way you described it will ensure that! Also would like to remain the same age watching your videos for 100 years more...the one on aging too... I am not a fan of reading too...but I do prefer these type of books over any novels. Thanks for these suggestions! \n",
      "765 Hi Ken, are there any books on the topic that you found useless despite being often recommended? Here's my small list: 1. How will you measure your life? By Clayton Christiansen 2. Never split the difference by Chris Voss who is the former FBI negotiator 3. You are a badass by Jen Sincero - a very powerful self-help book 4. The Psychology of Money by Morgan Housel - so far my favourite book about financial literacy\n",
      "766 While in general on par with most, I always wonder why people are so sure about what a \"good\" habit is. So in general I think everyone should be make sure about that before jumping to conclusion on how to achieve these \"good\" habits as efficient and fast as possible. Just an example: is efficiency something that is always better than inefficiency. That's why I highly recommend something like: Henry Miller - Colossus of Maroussi Nietzsche - On the Genealogy of Morality Beauvoir - The Mandarins etc. Made me wonder whether optimization is the holy grail :)\n",
      "767 It's good to see you uploaded this video! I'm always looking for great book recommendations on the topic. I'm going to add Digital Minimalism, Breathing, and Why We Sleep to my next reads list! I've read Atomic habits and it's indeed a great book. I've read a few personal development books, as I'm fascinated with the topic and always looking to increase my productivity and personal character. The first book I've read on the topic that got me started with everything else is \"7 habits of highly effective people.\" That book did the same for me as Atomic habits did for you. I recommend it, it's a very interesting read. Btw, I'm halfway of reading Getting Things Done. It's a great book, and it has added immediate value to my life already. I recommend it, too.\n",
      "768 I am ashamed of not being able to recommend any book in this regard :3 I will definitely be reading more starting with this list ! ( I share Ecstacy's disappointment btw Haha ) I think I'll start with Atomic Habits ! Thank you Ken :)\n",
      "769  Move over firefighters!!! Here's comes the Data Scientists calendar!! \n",
      "770 BAM! Love the shirt!! :)\n",
      "771 Hey love book 3! I told my boss to talk about the importance of sleep because of this book\n",
      "772 Great recommendations \n",
      "773 Love me some \"Atomic Habits\", I think it looks like a favorite here in the comment section as well! Also was looking at your books on your bookshelf (#creeping) and saw you had \"Storyworthy\". I just started this book!\n",
      "774 I have also read the combo Cal Newport + James Clear + Matt Walker. The have radically reahaped me, and following their advices during the past year has generated some serious improvements in my life\n",

      "777 I wrote my bachelors thesis about a programm I wrote in R. I like it :)\n",
      "778 Hello sir, thank you for your recommendation. I just bought a book named Getting Things Done -- The Art of Stress-free Productivity by David Allen, hopefully it is good. It was recommended by someone else. Also, recently read The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas Stanley, it really helps to establish a healthy idea on wealth and wealth management. Best Regards.\n",
      "779 Great list! Thanks for sharing :) I am afraid to read the one about sleep though.... \n",
      "780 Love the thumbnail... will take people's breathe away.\n",
      "781 Atomic habits is my favorite definitely. I am currently reading \" Crushing it\" By Gary vee\n",
      "782 I recommend \"How Not to Die\" by Michael Greger\n",
      "783 I was expecting some thirsty people in the comment section but it's a little too clean kek\n",
      "784 Great video Ken, Atomic Habits and Why We Sleep are definitely some of my favourites. I also particularly enjoyed The Courage to be Disliked / Happy \n",
      "785 Just Osho will change your life. No other book needed.\n",
      "786 Almost forgot: I do have a suggestion of a book in english: It's \"the bullet journal method\" by Ryder Caroll. Most sites who talk about bullet journaling have actually no idea what the method is truly about which is about focusing on important matters in your life and WHY they matter. Not having something beautiful or gating people out because \"your stuff is no bullet journal\". Ie: I do mine using small binders and not a notebook and it works for me but people have told me \"this is not a bullet journal\" and yet it's still a pretty functional bullet journal. Also, in the same vein of atomic habits, I can recommend Elasitc habits by stephen guise, he's my go to guy when it comes to habit. And this book is about having habits that adapt to the circumstances of your life. How to maintain one when things are very hard and how to maximize the benefits of a good day.\n",
      "787 Yoo Ken what a flex in the thumbnail!! Loved your recommendations and have read Atomic Habits myself and am considering to read Digital Minimalism. Well here are some of my recommendations which are about life and I guess psychology: 1: *Man's search for meaning*- A must read definitely 2: *What Every body speaks* - How to read Body language 3: *Beyond Freedom and Dignity*- BF Skinner classic (an interesting read) 4: Works by *Dostoyevsky* and *Tolstoy* - you know the classics 5: *So you have been publicly shamed*- Definitely something for the social media world. 6: *Influence: the psychology of persuasion* 7: *As a man thinketh* Well the list does go on but I hope this will be of some value to you \n",
      "788 You might also be interested in the practice of self hypnosis. It helps clear the mind, relax the body and increase mental focus for, say, doing machine learning ;) The problem is my main source of information on the subject is from a french guy named Benjamin Lubszynski. He has a youtube channel unfortunately in french and two books, also in french. That being said I'll look for english sources for this as I believe it is a lovely habit from which everyone can benefit and its benefits are many :) (greater than meditation as it takes its source from the subconscious which makes it both more accessible than meditation but also much more effective).\n",

      "797 I thought that was a wedding ring not a sleep tracker xD I am tracking my eating habits, meditation, sports/yoga, reading and productive work.\n",
      "798 Thanks for sharing. It seems like one of those areas which you don't really get the hang of unless you're in the industry, simply because companies have that infrastructure built.\n",
      "799 As a person who has left a very technical role in a small fast startup to a bigger, corporate-like env, I can truly relate to you. All I do is to do project scoping for data science projects, framing the models to the business use cases, and watch vendors do the fun data science stuff. I kind of miss the hustle in the startup though. I guess life is not perfect.\n",

I've wanted to start a podcast for months now but I'm fairly introverted so I've been putting it off. Your comment about controlling the environment instead of being controlled by it hit the nail on the head and I've never thought about it that way. Thanks for sharing that Ken!

      "827 KNN is really a great channel with great content, I love the style of \"insert situation/problem\" as the video/podcast topic, this makes it a lot better for someone to relate to.\n",
      "828 I'm thinking of starting sort of an anti-podcast and titling it something super awkward like, \"Nobody Should Listen to This Podcast.\" I'd describe it as an arrogant jerk and his (formerly) inner monologue. That way, it's half satirical reverse psychology, half self-sabotage. Which is sort of my thing, really. \n",
      "829 I started a podcast mainly coz I just wanted to learn how to talk to people. To get out of my social awkwardness. And it worked!! Absolutely agree with all the points you have made and even though I have only done 2-3 episodes I can relate very much!! Am very much looking forward to resume my podcast work after my college applications and all thanks to you Ken!! My podcast isn't that interesting, it's completely random hahaha(It did make Tina laugh tho ). Let's see if my brain helps me to make interesting content \n",
      "830 You make a good case that podcasting can bring you lots of benefits. Similar to blogging. But also similar to blogging for personal gain, is this something we want to be promoting? Shouldn't we only create content that we think might be valuable to others? As an example, Medium has some amazing blogs to learn data science, but is also filled to the brim with garbage blogs that where data science beginners show off their skills while only pretending to educate or provide value to others. These blogs waste other people's time, and crowd out the good stuff making it harder to find. I don't want to be elitist and say that only the best blogs/podcast should exist, but I feel like this 'just throw it out there and let the internet decide' may not be the best approach\n",

Whats the rythm youre advising please ? Thank you in advance\n",
      "837 thanks ken jee for informative videos..i have a concerning question regarding choosing Data Science as non-tech background. with growing data science students would u think it will be still in demand in next 2-3 yrs or so, like if we start on this path it would take 2-3 yrs and by that time it might be outdated or there will be abundance of Data scientist? How about Videos on Data scientist as a freelancer. thanks again.\n",

      "839 As much as I admire this series, blindly making a tutorial where your copy and pasting code as part of a tutorial -- which is aimed at beginner's is not the best way to teach, as more often than not, they won't understand what's going on, selenium is easy enough to read the docs for, this could of been achieved by showing your process how you would do this on your own.\n",

      "887 Im a seasoned data analyst and can say the following. The big data domain, so thats data science (aka machine learning), data analytics and business intelligence, are tech fields, but not colourful ones. The focus is business strategy from a data-driven perspective. You do not deliver products as you will not be building or designing applications. You deliver insights, and in time this will have an impact on the business. So no fast/direct impact. Very high-level. You need to like thinking long-term about the business. So no colour, no app building, no designing. Its all about strategy. You are not a developer; you are a strategist. So if you see yourself doing that, go for it. If you see yourself building or designing, dont go for it and go for development/designing jobs. Now, there actually is a development type of job in the big data domain: data engineering. But thats boring and really the data preparation work that nobody wants to do. They just prepare the data for the analysts to analyse. Thats it. Im sorry for all the data engineers reading this, but its the truth and you know it. But hey, if you have a passion for that, go for it what can I say. So this sums it up. Good luck \n",

I want to add one more to your analogies if I may... Good quality food = Good quality data. Often times neglected, but makes the most impact =) Also, here is a riddle for all foodies and people who loves to cook. I came up with this after many years of cooking and baking. Here it is: What is in every recipe that you doesn't have a taste? The answer also makes sense from the data science perspective =)\n",

I am trying to follow along with the video, but I get the following error: \"<input>:1: DeprecationWarning: find_element_by_* commands are deprecated. Please use find_element() instead\" I am trying to replace all \"find_element_by_xpath\" with find_element(by=XPATH, value = xpath) but I cannot figure out how to make it work! I would highly appreciate any advice!\n",
      "918 Communication, man. It is very underestimated. Most of the time, we can achieve much more if we collaborate with others. On the other hand, it requires one to have strong communication skills to manage such a collaborative organization. Unfortunately, people opt out collaborating because they fail to communicate. I am not talking about just talking to each other. I am talking about \"understanding each other\" and willing to solve problems together. 2 years ago, before my PhD oral exam, one wise professor in my PhD committee told me to relax and enjoy the process because no PhD student can be smarter than 5 professors testing you. That was a great advice, and it is very true that we are stronger together IF we can communicate to be a coherent group. With that said, I am wondering if there is a video about different \"data\" related roles. I am looking for internships. There are different roles, such as data engineer, data scientist, data analyst, machine learning engineer, AI engineer, etc... I have a broad idea how they differentiate, but I would like to learn more about these roles and their requirements. I quickly skimmed your videos, Ken, but couldn't find a video about it. I mean a video including all these roles, not just comparing data analyst and data scientist. If there is one, can you point me it? If not, it would be great to see a video about that. You are doing great work popularizing the field and making data science accessible to more people, Ken. Thank you! =)\n",
      "919 I have been working on data analytics projects for 2-3 months now and i have to agree, i am making so many mistakes and so many things are getting lost but the more i work, the more i am learning and the more im practicing and its been a great experience for me honestly. Data analyst/science is probably the most fun job out there and the most challenging one.\n",

      "933 I think business strategy is important for data scientists, and then learning to deal with ambiguity. Business majors are great at dealing with ambiguity where as technical people such as engineers, data scientists etc struggle with a lot. By ambiguity, I mean that in business, 1 + 1 does not equal 2... it could equal 3 or 5 or -2.\n",

When I plot my dataframe there (df = pd.read_csv('glassdoor_jobs.csv'; print(df)) I do not get a terminal where I can explore the whole data (like Ken does). Instead what I get is the df cut off. I can explore it by using some commands like \".head(20)/.tail(20)/etc...\" and specifying the columns that I want to be shown, but it's kind of annoying and you may not find some variables that need to be cleaned by doing that. Does anyone know what could I do to display the whole dataframe outside Sublime Text to explore it? Ty very much!\n",

My LSA model was scoring at 4% lmao. it was hilariously bad. It really was humorous to me just how bad they were performing. I was able to (over some grueling months) get my W2V model up to 65% accuracy which for the task at hand, I still consider to be quite good honestly.\n",

In real data, outliers can exist in more than half of the features and make analysis challenging. Should I remove all outliers? When is the best time (or stage) to remove them? During data cleaning or after building the very first model for inference? Thanks!\n",

      "971 Thank you so much for your great content, Ken! I enjoy your channel so much. I'm kind of an outlier here. LOL I did a masters in statistics in the 80's and then was a statistical consultant for agricultural projects using SAS for several years. After a 35-year hiatus from formal data analysis (but not from thinking data and teaching math) I came back last year to complete a data science certification to try to get up to speed in the data world. Wow! What a challenge! I did one big project for my certification, but I want to do several more for my own benefit and for my portfolio before I start looking for contracts. Your videos give me lots of possibilities. I just really enjoy how you present ideas. Thank you again.\n",

Also, did your model take into consideration the judges themselves as (in)consistent variables? Everyone's first attempts at something don't look good as subsequent efforts, particularly after years of experience. Do you apply how you've \"failed\" (even today) to improving your skills or possibly utilize the failure data as part of your model(s)?\n",

I have a team of four undergrads working for me so right now I'm still trying to figure out what it is I'll want to analyze and present to the grant makers but we have some time to figure that part out. Do you have any advice for the pre-planning phase of research? I feel more comfortable in my coding than I do in project management but in this case, it's all part of the same project.\n",

Like what you've told us, it really consuming my energy and time at the point where I don't spend a lot of time with people around me. Kinda hard to find balance but I really enjoy what I'm doing and preparation for coming years.

      "1078 Quick question : what tech or languages do I need to learn to be a data scientist?\n",
      "1079 This is a good basis to show video. I learned step by step data cleansing method applied by KJ and created my Data Cleansing Framework via it. Thanks man! Awesome! From Faizal, Malaysia\n",
      "1080 How to copy multipage code: ( BTW yours videos are awesome .. like real crispy and to the point ) 1. Mouse click on the starting position say .. def 2. scroll down ( No mouse selection .. just scroll ) the position to the point and the click while you hold the shift button.. * Please ignore if someone already suggested the same..\n",
      "1081 Innovative project. Love it. Excellent presentation of good exploratory data analysis skill.\n",
      "1082 I like the visualization video i think i have already commented about it but i had a question what is most used s visual libraries which has better visualization option? i have been using matplotlib and seaborn for a while but i know i have to go with trend of plotly so do you think plotly something worth learning when you already know matplotlib and seaborn? Thank you!!\n",
      "1083 I agree with most of the things you said about the algorithms being so good and that it would be very inefficient for your phone to listen constantly to everything. Specifically, it would not be possible for the speech to text to happen constantly on your phone because of intense battery drain. Similarly it would also be impossible to send voice recording constantly over data because you would notice data usage from your provider. However, you can clearly see that when you say the keyword e.g. \"Ok google\", or \"hey Siri\" the phone is actually listening. So google could for example implement a list of keywords, that various companies want advertised, and that would also be silently monitored and when they actually find a match in the list, then they could show the ad. In essence they don't actually analyze all the things you say, they just listen for some keywords that they are interested in.\n",
      "1084 Thanks a lot! I'm just beginning with Data Science. I 'don't understand, why you transform \"norm_Fare\" to a Dummy-Variable with 0/1?\n",

      "1086 I love your channel, thanks very much\n",
      "1087 Hello Ken! I'm a fresh grad a BA in math and minor in statistics and would really like to break into the data world. I've been self studying for several month now and have some grasp of python (np, pandas, plt) and sql. Despite knowing the technical I feel like I'm struggling with the domain knowledge and when and how to apply statistical methods to my work. Would you recommend me bootcamp to shore up my weaknesses and have a support system to assist me with job finding. Money and time is mostly not an issue.\n",
      "1088 Great video! Do you perhaps know whether should beginner in ML have good knowledge of statistics to even start learning it, and advanced knowledge of calculus and linear algebra?\n",
      "1089 Ken Jee? how old were you when you first started the data science?\n",
      "1090 I am coming to just write that i just had meeting about my data science project with mt CEO and let me tell you they literally confused me by complicating it haha.\n",
      "1091 I work at a market research firm as an analytics client manager. I create many deliverables from our proprietary research/data, but I dont know if I can share those publicly given NDAs. Im not looking to leave at the moment, but for the future, do you have any thoughts on how to showcase my work? I guess I could maybe scrub the data, but Im not sure how effective the story would come across at that point.\n",
      "1092 One question A very first day of learning and I am land to this video is it worth if I cross educate myself?\n",
      "1093 Still valid approach in September of 2021. One mistake that most of the beginner do is to that they try to master stuff in one go but forget to consider that you can't master programming(python in our case) by watching tutorials after tutorials in one go. Rather to work on your building projects. In this way you will go through trial and error and will learn alot.\n",
      "1094 I suppose the first challenge is the most obvious especially in a bank I work for. All dudes are at least holders of Masters in Maths or CS etc. In my current position I work within members of this team and they're all very good in DS.\n",

      "1142 Hi Ken, Great videos as always. I followed this one until 12:07. I am seeing 1.000 for R-squared and 0 for all P-values. Back in part 2, when doing the scraper I had to cut the numbers down to 250 because the process kept disconnecting. During data cleaning that number was cut down to 38. Although the numbers were vastly different compared to yours, I was able to work with it because it still produced all of the insightful analysis. Now I'm unsure if I should continue because both R-squared and P-values look weird\n",

      "1166 Hey Ken. Nice video. I am an experienced economist. I have a a BA and MA in economics and finance. I have worked for 8 years in economics and econometrics. This basically entails extensive data analysis and statistics around economic issues, so I am very good with statistics, regressions, inference, and causality (a big thing in econometrics). However, in economics we mostly use Stata as the go to software. I am really interested in shifting to data science as I have a huge passion for data analysis. I need to learn the languages commonly used in data science (R, python) but I am strong on the statistical background. Any insights on whats best and where to start keeping in mind that I am currently a full-time economist. So the transition has to be gradual or more like a side-hustle in the beginning. Thanks\n",

      "1168 Just started a Module in my Google Data Analytics Course where I get to learn about Data Visualisation. As a kid I was always into sketching, colouring or some form of Imagery. As I grew up I could identify and nurture my storytelling skills. So far, with whatever I have read and learnt about Data Visualisation it seems like a party for an art and design lover like me who also loves storytelling. And this video of yours nails it to the end. I just hope I do well and make the most of data visualisation Module now.\n",
      "1169 Yes, I whole heartily agree with you that education is a important requirement. I would be careful in putting \"Barrier to Entry\" and \"Education\" in the same sentence. A lack of education is a barrier to achieve one's potential. Also you need to apply what you learn and not let it perish or atrophy over time. I have copied code that I didn't fully understand and got it work. I believe that there are amatuer data scientists out there that one day could turn professional.\n",
      "1170 I liked watching all the videos with your in-depth work. What I though was missing is an example of how it work when a user sent the information to the server and how and what information was displayed, the end product that provide information so that the user can make a decision from the data.\n",

Quick Question, sometimes I get the following error: StaleElementReferenceException: stale element reference: element is not attached to the page document I think It may have something to do with my internet connection, because it happens randomly during the scraping process. I guess the question is does the file have to feature 1000 entries? I think working with a smaller data pool might prevent the random error. Will something like 500 or even 250 work?\n",

I know product people can be cryptic as well love your vids Ken!\n",
      "1207 While \"a picture is worth a thousand words\", the RIGHT picture is far more meaningful as many artist / photographers might point out. I recently did an assessment where lots of questions were about which visualization conveyed a particular point or what statement is represented.\n",

I remember as a child I used to play soccer on PlayStation 2 a lot, and they had plenty of charts like radar charts for players and teams to rank them by skill (attack, defense, speed, ... ), trees to rank players and clubs in different leagues, soccer fields with different sized circles to show ball possession ... It was awesome, we would literally spend 10 minutes before each match just looking at the graphs to choose the best Formation. I don't think we would've liked PS2 as much without those visualizations, even as kids they generated high value for us as consumers and for the company as a business.\n",

      "1255 Hi Ken Jee, Thanks for sharing so much great info from a personal perspective. I just subscribed to your newsletter but can't leave a comment below a video. Why? Set that way, problem my end, or problem with set-up. So, for your video, A Quick Data Science Project Tip #shorts, I will comment here. Rather than try to make the Iris data set interesting with a good story (same for the Titanic one), why not just choose a more interesting dataset? Kaggle has ones on wine, California wildfires, Covid vaccines, the covid-19 virus, Olympic medals, and so many more. My tip is to take the time to find a compelling dataset for your class assignments / projects. It's better than trying to make up a great use for that boring iris file. (I did look up \"sepal\" though and learned a lot from class examples.) https://www.kennethjee.com/newsletter\n",
      "1256 as a newcomer to golf during the pandemic I'm absolutely hooked by the sport and find your content a gem :) hopefully more and more golf equipment manufacturers will incorporate ML/AI into the process of making the clubs which also present itself as a great marketing opportunity such as what Callaway is already doing. I'm hopeful that the future of the golf simulation market relys on visual based ML/AI and will drive the costs down for the barrier of entry so that more ppl can enjoy golfing at home!\n",
      "1257 It's obvious to many that the current 3pt line is not far enough from the rim but it's fascinating to see that there's data backing it up and to pinpoint to where the ideal distance is, super fascinating work! It's no wonder that more and more teams such as the Utah Jazz are trying to eliminate the mid-range 2's entirely and replace those with 3's instead, but it's also interesting to see players like CP3 does not shy away from the mid-range 2's in the clutch (and has the full freedom to do so) likely backed by their individual statistics that is way above the league average thus making it a worthwhile shot.\n",

I conducted a social experiment and survey for my class to determine the level of susceptibility to disinformation, controlling for both weekly online hours and strength in political party affiliations. The results were interesting, but I wanted to improve on the experiment by: 1. increasing the number of participants 2. improving the set of questions 3. collecting which sites had the most activity for each participant on a given week. This would be considered a regression problem, yes? Since I am attempting to predict performance based on consistent behavior. What programs would be considered ideal to collect this type of data for my analysis?\n",

      "1345 The fact that you just said , \"the first thing to know is programming\" shows the level or lack of your mathematical understanding behind the concepts of something which might seem to be as trivial as linear regression. However, most if not all credible data scientists know the complexity of math behind the aforementioned concept , ranging from intercept interpretation to exchanging penalties with constraints in regularized models which will branch out to more non linear models like svm's using KKT theorem.. Please stop misleading people like this... Regards, A novice Data Scientist.\n",

Finally, May your cousin rest in peace and find happiness in the afterlife :)\n",
      "1347 When I was starting my Ph.D. in Computational Biology, I discovered Data Science. Now I'm slowly changing my focus to it. CompBio uses many disciplines and concepts in common with DS, which was a very satisfying discovery when I started to read about DS. I think it's very nice to be called Master, but man, Doctor Weiss sounds *SO evil scientist* that I couldn't help myself when choosing my path. It's just what I wanted since I was 4 LOL But seriously, although I'm just migrating but not there yet, it seems to me that many (or most) areas that include programming and statistics will have a good match in DS.\n",

Also, was taking notes all through the stream, and added some of my thoughts: 1. Yes there are a lot of tools out there particularly stuff that will automate and streamline DS and ML workflows. There are however a TONNN of companies which have barely scratched the surface when it comes to DS having an adept captain at the wheel is going to be the difference between them being successful versus not. (18:24) 2. Advice on self studying data science, just get started with something! 100% hands down the best advice, pick something youre interested in and go for it (32:31) 3.

It recieves a request from the user and we get the response It is important for data scientist's because of :- a) best way to access data. Many websites gives access to data through API b) reliable and consistent c) one of the best ways to make your model useful is to turn it into an API d) saves us time through reusability (leveraging pre built models) How to use an API? Find a documentation for an API of your interest and send a request to API How to make API? Create a basic web server that takes requests and returns responses\n",

I, like you mentioned about yourself, need structure around the learning/schedule of it all for me to succeed. Knowing most positions in data science require(or greatly prefer) a masters/PhD, I think a bachelor's degree in the field would be a great place to start, right?

      "1562 I think you are a bit nave - 90% of people who can do something profitable but naughty without reasonable fear of getting caught simply do it. Endless university social experiments have proven this. I think that when they do it, they make sure it is hidden behind layers of plausible deniability - so the component that listens is purchased from a third party and it was some 'bad man hacker from Russia' who broke into the server room through the roof and so on. They will make sure their reputation stays clean even if it means running a 'black ops' operations where the people who do the work have no idea who they are working for. Only an Edward Snowden type event will blow the lid off - and that will be very unprofitable for the individual concerned.\n",

I'm very much obsessed with A.I sci-fi, and i have one big startup project that i would love to build my self as an side project along the way while I'm studying too. I have 11 years of experience in marketing, business management, had an marketing agency once did pretty good. Could you enlighten me on this subject, would 4 years be enough to get a job afterwards. Currently i have all the time in the world to study. Thank you so much. Have a nice day. \n",

      "1586 Your explanation makes a lot of sense when you look at it from the outside. The bandwidth needed to listen and store all audio to target ads is beyond comprehension. Look, Google gets the lionsshare of their revenue from advertising. I believe it's in the 90% range. If they aren't helping business owners grow their businesses, they stop making that money, so if they tell you they are going to use less tracking on you, it's not out of the goodness of their heart.....it's because they can accomplish the same goals with less resources.\n",

I havent so much as typed a French translation into my phone. However after a night at a friends with our kids I had been speaking a bit of French to him and the kids. The next two days several French ads started appearing when browsing and recommended videos on French started appearing on YouTube. Now some of you might think, oh it's just that they used the \"friend\" algorithm and figured they would send you ads in french. Except that I live in Thailand, and I don't get ads in Thai....why? Because I don't speak any Thai and never have, despite obvious amounts of Thai being spoken around me, I never speak it so it has never picked up my voice speaking Thai.\n",

No no I can't continue i am gonna give up\" just because this video??? Why don't you encourage all people to work in this field encourage, motivate them?? , but in fact it is not difficult, it just needs to work hard... You're already making videos related to data science, but why would you put someone down when they've found a dream and want make it comes true?? And also make him worry that he might back off and you prove that belief in his head? Also at the beginning of the video you talk about this as if it is impossible for normal people to do Sorry, but your introduction to the challenges that will face any student or a normal person who has decided to major in data science will lead him to desperation from the beginning of the video\n",

I am interested in Data Science because of the strong career possibilities but also the problem solving abilities. I also believe that as someone in the art and design space with command over Data Science principles I will be able to do more. Out of all these what would you suggest I undertake?

I personally love the resource as a place to practice and learn new skills while being able to collaborate and work together with others, however, GitHub has always been my go-to to highlight all the individual work I have done that I want to show off to employers!\n",

In the past 5 months my main accomplishment was the IBM certificate in Data Science and Im so happy to say I secured my first job as a Jnr Data Scientist starting last week!!! Its possible guys, keep up the hard work!\n",
      "1715 Hey ken I have a question Ive spoken to you before , back when I was getting started with the google data analytics certificate Im done with the program now and I noticed they didnt teach us how to create models and test sets and stuff what would you suggest I do next ? Im guessing machine learning is an important aspect of being a data analyst .. should I take a course on that and get that out of the way ?\n",
      "1716 Is there any checklist one can follow or we can choose what we want to learn.\n",

      "1725 Wow, thanks for the video, and I'm just switching over my career now and I'm really concerned, I feel old because I just a starter programmer and trying to learn data science from zero. And now I just don't know what to say, I guess I don't have any possible way to not continued to pursue this career. There is something amazing and special about this. Something from the core from the foundation that I want to learn, to know, and master. The problem is that none of us are immortals. But I will continue to persist, thanks again for sharing...\n",
      "1726 Hi Ken, i love the way you are making the videos for the entire DS process. I would like to add a point for this video where I suggest if you have spent the feature selection process Or criterias to add more values to model and this video. Just my 2 cents for the video. It's good work done. Keep going. All the best\n",

      "1766 Thank you for sharing your insights. I am a working professional in the chemical industry (14 years experience) with an applied/pure mathematics degree and am at this point of decision making. I have been accepted into my local accredited university for their Masters of Data Science program. I have also been accepted into GaTechs Data Science boot camp, and am currently doing the Google Certification to get some bearings. I really dont want to wait the 3.5 years it would take to get my masters to enter into this field and would rather start into an entry job at least before I work on my degree, but I also dont have much of the specific data experience from my current position to get me there. Do you believe a math degree along with the bootcamp would carry weight? do you know any colleagues that took a similar route? I feel that my math background allows me to be more than capable for the job, but convincing an employer of this without certs or anything else under my belt is a challenge. I am also open to obtaining my Masters while working in data, Im all about continuing education. Any opinions and advisement are appreciated.\n",

With my age, I feel like I need to REALLY learn this stuff faster and better than my peers because I'm already 'behind'. I haven't learned all the concepts, but I do know R, python and basic stats including regression, logistic regression, decision trees and random forests. I love data science, even though I don't understand it all yet. Anyone have other youtubers that I can follow, in addition to Ken. I'm not worried about not understanding everything yet, I just want to expose myself to the topics. I know at some point, it will come together and \"click\"\n",
      "1808 hi. I had a question. is there are something different data science and data scientist or are they same\n",

      "1810 Great content! Id like to add to getting the yes. I think its just as important to get a no or an objection early on that way you can discover info that would otherwise be a hidden roadblock further in the sales journey.\n",
      "1811 Honestly i dont know what you are on about... Having worked as a Data Scientist for our government and for the 2nd largest bank of my country (Rabobank) i can say with confidence that a data scientist is just a data analist with some data engineering and statistics experience... Mabey not easy but far from impossible. Second point i like to point out is that you should not want to work as a data scientist the rest of your life. You get paid significantly less for your work than for example working as a financial analist or data consultant/manager.. Your career path if you want to not get scammed (at least in my country) should be something along the line of: - BSc Business Informatics or Information Science - Work 1-2 year as an IT consultant or Data Engineer - MSc in Data Science, Econometrics or Statistics/Mathematics - Work 1 year as a Data scientist at a decent company - Switch jobs and work as a Financial Analist, Data Manager or IT manager. You get paid significantly more for basically less work.. my salary went from 3400 to about 5200 in 1 year. Worth it people...\n",

I know umich is kind of a prestigious school, but I got rejected from UCLA, UC Berkeley, NYU, the Ivies, etc. for undergrad. I want to potentially go to one of these schools for my masters in data science. Do you think its a stretch? Umich is way harder than expected, and my CGPA is 3.4 and my major CGPA is 3.06. I feel like my CGPA is way to low to be aiming for these schools so I was wondering what my target schools should be when applying for masters. (I also do not have much experience coding due to my major) Thank you! :)\n",

      "1890 Great content as Usual ! I love Notion and Cal Newport's books as well! Of course, Tracking Pappayas has to be in the Habit tracker \n",
      "1891 Awesome video! Stumbled across this video while looking for information on searching for a masters program. Completed my undergrad in accounting but considering pursuing a masters in data science at DePaul. All these tips certainly help. Thanks again for your knowledge!\n",
      "1892 Reason 1: I don't want to\n",
      "1893 1) learn programming(python) 2) get familiar with stats and algorithms 3) code review(go to kaggle) 4) do as many projects as you can now Note: these need not to be done in sequence and don't try to master them, get a basic understanding and make learning a habit Last thing: engage with community\n",
      "1894 hello, I would really appreciate an advice on choosing between data science and software engineering. I studied Economics ad University, but it has never been my passion. After years of academic studies in the field of Economics I started coding for the first time, in Python. Since then I developed a true passion for programming. I currently know Python very well as well as Django to a basic level. I have done several projects with these. During this path I also had the opportunity to learn Data Science/ML basics. I am really undecided on which career to pursue. These are the things I like mostly: - programming, a lot (this would make me think I more suitable for software engineering) - using Git and Github - discovering insights, extracting meanings (this sounds more like data science) - creativity. I feel I am very creative, and not really a math person. - languages, both computer and human: I love english (I am not english mother tongue) I find Data Science fascinating and being a data scientist would surely \"make more sense\" given my background compared to being a software engineering. Also, it requires some skills such as clear communication and presentation skills that I feel I have. However, I fear that data science would not value what I think are (or might become) my strongest skills, creativity and programming, and instead would require me to work more on math on a daily basis. I do not think I would enjoy working with math every day. Thank to anyone who took the time to read, sorry for being too long :)\n",
      "1895 Hi Ken, do you have any recommendations on projects related to NBA?\n",
      "1896 I know this is random question, but to make sure I'm understanding the data, at 14:59 does the last row mean that 2 people had 5 cabins?\n",
      "1897 I will thank you once I get job in Data science.\n",
      "1898 nice\n",
      "1899 woo!\n",
      "1900 The Impostor Syndrome usually refers to the nagging fear of being labeled a fraud for having a job we dont feel were qualified for or receiving an award or recognition that we dont feel we actually deserve. A variation should be called the Average Person Syndrome for the frustrating feeling of not being enough. News and social media frequently show us things like grade school students developing apps or web sites to address some issue of the Covid pandemic, or podcasters, YouTubers and Twitter tech influencers with thousands of followers. This can leave average people second guessing their ideas and projects as not being significant enough when compared to others on display.\n",
      "1901 Heavily relate to feeling overwhelmed at times! I've always felt overwhelmed when I think about how vast the field of data science is and all that there is to learn and keep up with. What helped me was understanding that I will not 100% know and understand everything and that is okay, nobody does:) Taking small baby steps and learning through 1 project as a time has been a huge success for me & for those trying to learn, I highly recommend the \"Data Science Project By Scratch\" series on Ken's channel!\n",
      "1902 Thank you for the informative video \n",
      "1903 This time i will try hard to stick with my goal .Thank you sir for motivation\n",
      "1904 Ken, I really liked the podcast with Aash and Jeremie Harris. You've got a good community around your channel, and this was a solid video.\n",
      "1905 I need to find time to watch this\n",
      "1906 Thank You Sir God bless You\n",
      "1907 Do you think an undergraduate degree in data science is worth doing if its something that interests me? I don't reckon you're too familiar with many uk univerisites (my bad if i am mistaken) but i have an offer to study data science at warwick, and an offer to study computer science at manchester - the main reason i consider the data science degree is because i like the look of it a lot, but if i keep an interest in coding (though the degree has a lot of options for coding modules within it already), that I won't really be doing myself any wrong picking the data science undergrad over the computer science undergrad? My main concern is only that a cs grad may be viewed slightly more preferable in a range of places just by degree name, but i dont know if thats true or not\n",
      "1908 Just started reading book One Thing as per your advice. Thanks for great content .\n",
      "1909 really nice to see im not the only one. thanks Ken\n",
      "1910 \"You will never become a data scientist\" .... but .... I am one.\n",
      "1911 Human brain can predict well human thoughts & problems too than artificial intelligence so that u made this video for us!!!!\n",
      "1912 This was helpful. Thank you.\n",
      "1913 The best way to overcome discouragement i found is to accept failure. Accept that you are gonna fail but also have the confidence that you are gonna get through it if you work hard. Recently was given a task which I thought I could never do. Right now, i just finished the prototype for it and will be presenting it on Monday :)\n",
      "1914 I am still in the learning stage. These are my core learning areas: * Stats * Computer tools - R, Python, SQL What else?\n",
      "1915 Hi mate i Love Your video's so Much , i Come From a Background with me only graduate in My Community. Can I Get Your Mail? How do i contact you. I need some Career counselling. I would really appreciate it\n",
      "1916 It really does make sense. In order to get started with schoolwork, I bargain with myself and tell myself \"Just sit at the desk and see what happens\" and inevitably, I will be able to do at least a Pomodoro or two\n",
      "1917 Great info. It also makes sense that, companies would be happy to let a perrson they already know have the position, than going outside the company and it is a crapshoot. Quick question though. Do you think getting a data science certification would help make your case in transitioning or is that primarily to help get into the field?\n",
      "1918 Time and I have an oft adversarial relationship as well. I have been working on it. Btw, how did you do in the March Madness competition?\n",
      "1919 Not me who is coming here to see your communication skills in your first video xD\n",
      "1920 Thanks for the video ken! I didn't knew data scientists have so many options\n",
      "1921 Why didn't you choose a master's in Applied Statistics? I just put in an application for a grad certificate in Applied Stats yesterday. The choice of school was made for me by these factors; 1. No GRE required 2. No recs required 3. Three intakes a year so no waiting till next year 4. Non-exirbitant tuition (under $1,000 per credit) 5. On-line program\n",
      "1922 You very nicely explained all the mental barriers and how to overcome them. Thanks for helping all of us Ken .\n",
      "1923 Hi Ken, do you have any advice on reviewing kaggle code? Are there any kaggle competitions in particular that I should look for notebooks in that would be easy to learn from for beginners?\n",
      "1924 Great video as always Ken! For me, re-evaluating my Why helps to bring perspectives and motivation to get back up again. As you suggested, changing environments or taking a walk does really help to declog a stuck state. The realization that its okay not to know everything does give great comfort, great tips!\n",
      "1925 Hey ken just wanted to say I'm loving notion \n",
      "1926 Ahhaha..this video is perfectly put on what I feel day to day in my job\n",
      "1927 Ken, i study Petroleum Engineering. Can i study Data Science for master degree? And what can i do to be accepted by university with high probability? I have 3 years left in my bachelor degree.\n",
      "1928 So close to 150k lets gooo\n",
      "1929 Thank you so much for this\n",
      "1930 Absolutely, taking a break for a while while getting confusion and frustration has helped me as well. It's informative for lots of learners out there like me. Thank you so much for sharing, Ken.\n",
      "1931 My last project I decided to use sklearn and ended up with an overfitted and underfitted model. Definitely felt discouraged and realized taking a nap or tackling it after not thinking about it helped to feel more confident. Another is learning so much based on job postings. Have learned so much for Data Science and looking at SQL feels overwhelming. Thanks for this video and I'll probably watch it a few more times to help me.\n",
      "1932 Ken, I think that my therapist has helped me a lot in my journey as a Business Analyst. They have allowed me to get to the root of my problem, which is exactly what data science is about. I highly recommend pursuing EMDR with a trained therapist to tackle the core issues of one's character. This therapeutic journey has allowed me to get over myself and to just jump straight into my work problems.\n",
      "1933 Haha I love the light-up dinosaur! I'm thinking about transitioning to data science field ,and what you said about what you'd missed about data science resonated much with what I miss about engineering. Thank you for sharing your experience and expertise!\n",
      "1934 Timed breaks + personal metrics + community --> Great for the mind.\n",
      "1935 I've always struggled with building up the courage to teach others (especially online) due to imposter syndrome. What I realised was that you don't need to know everything to teach others, you just need to be their guide. You're both on the same journey, but you're just sharing the things that seem obvious to you which might not be to them :)\n",
      "1936 THAT'S ME!!\n",
      "1937 Hey Ken jee Can you make a video on top colleges for masters in data science in the world?\n",
      "1938 2:46 Ken very much resonate with this of taking the time to think and contemplate. I do this with short bike breaks during the day and it's done wonders with helping me come up with solutions to complex problems!! Thanks for sharing your insights on this important topic!!\n",
      "1939 Wow awesome @Ken Jee! Just acknowledging that everyone has these feelings by itself makes it easier, especially coming from you! And like other comments here, sometimes switching the problem/changing the tool to solve the problem also seems to help, maybe that's a point to add\n",
      "1940 This was awesome! I've been feeling discouraged because I would do well in interviews, even receiving compliments for my growth and enthusiasm, but then I'd be rejected, only to be invited to compete again. After 6 months of this, I've got an internship! Thank you for teaching me how to stick it out and go on, Ken. God bless you!\n",
      "1941 Working on a project helps me learn a lot faster. Main struggle is about what to leave than what to pick.\n",
      "1942 15 minutes of fresh air change your day\n",
      "1943 If I could add one thing to the last part of the video; something that has helped me a lot is changing the tool you use if you're really stuck .. I got stuck so bad creating a Dashboard that gets updated daily in R Shiny and got so frustrated .. I completely switched the language and did it on streamlit, I finished it all in one day afterwards ! Just like Tina once told me that you shouldn't be married to one course, the same thing could be said for DS tools ! I think this is super important because many people spend days working on one thing until they quit completely ..\n",
      "1944 Really really really excellent video! I needed to hear this. I just need to concentrate on my classes and keep moving forward. By any chance have you heard anything about the PG-AIML program at the University of Texas?\n",
      "1945 I usually have a special project and blog trackers so I give myself usually a week to complete a data science or a video game and write my data science blog\n",
      "1946 Hey Ken, great video. I actually installed everything perfectly but when I try to open the anaconda navigator directly, it does not open. Is this an installation issue?\n",
      "1947 Thank you for this video. But the bird pooped at 9:34 lol.\n",
      "1948 You feel even more discouraged if you are from India. Here in India as a computer engineer or computer science student the 2 mainstream ways of getting an internship or a placement is to do Development or do Competitive Programming and get a SWE job. If you choose Data Science and if you manage to get a job you will be paid half the amount of a SWE as a fresher. It leads to doubt... Am I doing the right thing?\n",
      "1949 Great content as always. I have a question, maybe it will help others too. I'm starting fresh in the DS journey. There's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and I felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too: One of the big reasons I decided to switch to DS is being an International career; I saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like Software Engineers ^^). However, I sensed that it's not the case with DS? I sensed like if I joined a certain industry as Data Scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. For example, you joined the DS world in the sport industry, right? Do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). Landing a job in a different company/industry is easy? Your opinion is much appreciated!\n",
      "1950 Hey, Ken. I have small request for you. Can you also pass my prize to the next winner. You already have given me many resources through this competition and those are really useful for me. I'm really grateful to you for your support and efforts for the community.\n",
      "1951 Great video, Ken. What I realized overtime is that youll never be free of worry, anxiety or feelings of inadequacy. But what Ive learned to accept is that these feelings are your body and minds way of self-regulating to push you past your comfort zone. Life is a struggle, learning new fields of study is a struggle, but as long as you learn to accept the struggle and push forward regardless, when you zoom out you should get a better picture in how much youve accomplished over a course of time. And you should be very proud about that.\n",
      "1952 Great stuff as always!\n",
      "1953 Refreshing Feels less burdened now.\n",
      "1954 These days when the notification for your video pops up and I am wasting my time, it feels so terrible (of course all because of my stupidity and procrastination). But it serves as a strong motivation for me to continue my project. But I need an independent drive and perhaps even a proper course to follow. The stuff on 365 Data Science seems good.\n",
      "1955 is your dad ever awake? curious to see his \"sleep ring\" results vs yours lol\n",
      "1956 PS I love that there are always papayas hidden in your videos. Its that same feeling of finding the pineapple in Psych.\n",
      "1957 I think importer syndrome seems to be what hits me hardest. After starting on a project it doesnt feel so daunting, but up until I start, it feels way too out of reach.\n",
      "1958 I was feeling discouraged but I didn't gave up the idea of diving into the field. That speaks in itself that I wanted to learn this . Great Video Ken!!! I needed it.\n",
      "1959 Yes, It's is really important to control time which we are spending on using tech products. Having some physical exercise and mediation is essential. During these days mostly people are following WFH pattern and spending too much time on using laptops and mobile phones including me but I'm trying to set boundaries to it because it has bad impacts on our health. Thank you Ken for this video it is really helpful \n",
      "1960 Being able to re-frame imposter syndrome into something that motivates you is game changing. Definitely not a master at it but I'm starting to get into that mindset. Also loving the podcast! Christian's journey from Photographer to Data Analyst was so amazing to listen to and highly inspiring.\n",
      "1961 You know what ken i needed this.... Ken i am so confused between using dash in python for making dashboard & using tableau for making dashboard... Can you distinguish between them... Both of them uses for visualization but which is better for quick visualization with less efforts\n",
      "1962 Hey Ken, what's better: 1. Computer science 2. Mathematics and computer science degree? Appreciate your opinion very much\n",
      "1963 In the last two weeks we set up a model registry with mlflow which allows to write model artifacts to the hdfs. We had deploy that in our Kubernetes Cluster and make that work with the hdfs. Volumes, kerberos tickets, different nodes. I even had a feeling of quitting the job because I am too dumb to be honest. In the end, we made it. We have to love the struggle, we dont get paid well because its easy, but because its hard. Splitting it up really helps, taking a break helps. Good advice in the video :-). Pro tip: To make it really stick, teach a colleague about it or make a youtube video about it. Kinda selfish reasons for a YT channel, but in the end its win-win ;-)\n",

      "1966 Right\n",
      "1967 I came back to this video just to tell you that my first ever DS interview will be on Monday :) And for everyone reading this I totally confirm what Ken said ! The only option I have for the moment is applying through job boards and cold emails .. After sending my resume to over a 100 job postings, I finally got one interview .. I hope I get it :)\n",

      "1976 Great video. I've been following this channel it's been a while. I'm at a tough crossroad now. My current field is Industrial Engineering (machinery maintenance). I want to switch to Data Science so I can make use of my academic knowledge to the full (Maths and Programming), also because I think DS is more Future Proof. I couldn't reach a firm decision yet, still hesitant. People who made a career shift to DS, what are your thought on this?\n",
      "1977 *opens the video* *sees windows on his desktop* *leaves*\n",
      "1978 i kinda find it cool, but too intense. I did a bachelors in law, then did a bachelors in business informatics. I did so much better in my informatics degree but the it was the most taxing and I would shut down and literally quit school a couple of days after projects and exams. I was quite a slow learner, despite my 3.7 gpa. Im just looking for a career that pays a lot where the skills required are not so broad. I feel like accounting could have done the trick. Im about to do an internship as a data analyst, im honestly still not sure about this path and I dont know many ppl as clueless as I am about their interests, after investing so much time in education. Any advice?\n",
      "1979 I am yet to break in this filed, but I totally get you. I really like to learn new things and this field is full of surprises. I love it.\n",
      "1980 Hey Ken, huge fan of your work. I'd like to add that \"data scientist\" is not the only job out there in the \"data field\". You could end up becoming a data engineer, data architect, data analyst, business analyst, systems analyst, software developer, cybersecurity analyst, decisions and operations analytist, etc. My point: you could start thinking you want to be a data scientists, but then realize your skill set and interests are better suited for any other of the areas I listed.\n",

Because I don't want to coding all my life. Sports analytics is interesting. What can I pursue if i really hate coding? Note: I got 98/100 in Java in academic course. But I don't like now. Sports analytics intrigued me because it showed me direct application of what I have learnt in my academics...and I am afraid to get into data analytics/science just because it has coding? How should I start ? Should I really do a formal 1 or 2 years Masters degree or just enroll for online courses? Can you specify some courses to get started?\n",

I am hosting this dataset on kaggle, here is a link (https://www.kaggle.com/victorfcastro/mg-brazil-covid19-reports-from-opendatasus). You can find more datasets from other states at a link in my data set description, we are gathering efforts in making public health data acessible. if you're interested in working with the dataset, remember to set \" encoding = 'ISO-8859-2' \" in the pd.read_csv function to adequate to our latin encoding. that was a big obstacle I would have never come across if I didn't start on this project currently struggling with making pandas function as I want it to\n",

      "2100 Hey Ken - I'm considering pulling the trigger on investing in 365 Data Science. It seems comprehensive and very reasonably priced. A lot of comm colleges I've looked at don't seem offer too many of these types of courses. While most of them have Calc 1 - III, they seem to be lacking in other areas (like data structures and stats courses beyond elementary stats). I realize they are only two year programs. Any insight regarding which CCs might be offering a more Data Science specific majors at some point in the near future? Would a comp sci program be of any use? I have been getting a lot out of working through some of these Kaggle projects. Honestly, just looking through the comments, code, and how previous projects were built are extremely helpful. (Your Titantic project example is certainly among them). I apologize for bombarding you with these long-winded questions. I do, however, greatly appreciate the insight you pump out via YouTube. As difficult as this material can be, I do find your words and wisdom inspiring. It's also nice to see occasional rays of light while sifting through all these reams of data, code, algorithms, and math. It does spark ideas in my \"not-so-mathematically-inclined\" brain. Thanks again\n",

It do you only \"add\" the source data and scripts so that each person needs to run everything in their local copies?\n",

It's funny you mentioned a lawyer making the transitioned into the field. Actually, I know a guy who made a virtually identical transition into a CS/DS related field. Personally, I don't possess that sort of professional esteem. I've worked a variety of jobs including tennis teaching pro/coach, commercial painting estimator, warehousing, etc. Unfortunately, I never earned my Bachelor's. While I came within range and have taken a series of biz-ad courses at a couple of comm colleges, I can't say that a degree is part of my repertoire. With all that being said, do you still think investing in a bootcamp would be the way to go? Would it perhaps be better for someone with my set of circumstances to at least pursue an Associates in Biz with a concentration in D Analytics? Indeed includes many Data Analyst positions where at least an Associates is preferred. I've also read articles stating that holding a Bachelor's is virtually a necessity in terms of getting one's foot in the door as a data analyst. Thanks again for your inspiring channel. I look forward to combing through all of your videos as I attempt to traverse this arduous journey to becoming a seasoned data scientist such as yourself.\n",

      "2305 26ft? You realize if this was the 4point line Steph Curry and Dame Lillard are going to murder the league. Steph is shooting 43.7 percent from 25-29 ft. He is shooting 45.3 percent from 30-35 ft. Dame is shooting 40% from 25-29 ft and 34% from 30-35 ft. Analytically shooting 25% from 4 is equivalant to shooting 50% from 2 point range. If Steph Curry was to shoot 43.7 percent from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 87% from 2 point range. If Dame Lillard is shooting 40% from 4 point range that is equivalent to shooting 80% from 2 point range. In context Shaq who was one of the most dominant players ever shot a field goal percentage of 58.2%.

      "2358 Hi Ken, registered for your conference on 18th and 19th May.\n",
      "2359 I 'm doing research in linguistics and I 've realised I need skills in organizing data properly. So, some time ago I became interested in data science. So far, I 've gone over some online lectures in statistics for data science and found myself really passionate about. I would like to proceed in the field but.. as I 'm not an undergraduate age person at all, after watching your video, I feel that's a too challenging road for me, and, unfortunately, I might appear to be quite old for that matter. Despite the fact people say that having proficiency in three foreign languages like I do may be an advantage in job hunting process in this area. What's your view.. Is it worth investing time in it..?)\n",
      "2360 #66 + 4: Not too many personal details here, but I will share this video with someone that is becoming a College Student, I do like how you motivate your findings on what is useful to do. I would love to go back to my College life and had this advice. The story about your first video (Predicting Crypto-Currency Price Using RNN lSTM & GRU) is funny, I'm glad that makes you a DS YouTuber!! #66daysofdata\n",

      "2365 I think #3 is person dependent. If you become to reliant on a coach/mentor then your problem is your mentor not coaching you to become a more self-sustainable data scientist. I'd have killed for a bit more guidance in my formative career years rather than go and try lots of solutions. Maybe it's person dependent? Either way, great video. Liked and subscribed!\n",
      "2366 Is it difficult to find a job after completing a masters in sports analytics?\n",
      "2367 Currently a data scientist at a faang company, everything he said was so true, I studied and clawed my way for 5 solid years to get my current role. However it never ends I will be starting my PhD soon just to keep up... be an SDE if you want money and work life balance\n",
      "2368 Thank you Ken ! The fire of obsession and stuck time are strongly correlated negatively for me, but as soon as I take a break and get my ... together I find success in the end. I used to wonder if I really love the field, but after listening to you in this video, I realized that feeling this way should be quite common. I would also add that a big mistake for DS beginners is not watching Ken and Tina's videos :) .. You guys give us all we need to stay on track\n",

      "2376 Hi Ken, I am an Computer Engineer and have a bachelor's degree on the same field. Furthermore, I am thinking of pursuing my further Studies in Data Science and I am currently working as a .NET developer(love to code). I found Math, Probability & Statistics interesting during my semesters over the years. So I think it would be good for me to practice with Data Science right? I'd like some of your feedbacks & btw awesome video :)\n",
      "2377 Hi Ken, thanks for the video. Just wondering, when you talk about the DS Masters, would that be a post-grad for general grad applicants (from different backgrounds), rather than data/software specific? I'm doing Maths (DA, Ops, Stats) and CS (ML) dual degrees... would that be sufficient, in terms of college qualifications, for most jobs (those not specifying PhD etc)? thanks\n",

      "2389 hey man, love your videos :). I know you are very experienced with video editing and data science (obviously), but I believe the audio mixing in your videos is not where it should be. I think you should take the time to learn basic sound and audio mixing (to make your voice more soothing etc.). A good example to learn from is the YT channel \"3blue1brown\", which has great audio mixing. Good luck with it!\n",

      "2393 Thanks for your video, sir! I'm now a freshman at university, when it's time to choose major. Do you recommend me to choose pure computer science or data science. I am confused because the major of data science is set in the school of bussiness at my university. There are many bussiness course to learn (almost the same amount as computer science). And there are not courses of the underlying knowledge about computer science (like computer network) Could you please give me some advice? Your words will be greatly appreciated!\n",

      "2441 Hi Ken - new subscriber here. Thank you so much for your words of wisdom. Was wondering if you'd have advice for someone in my situation: I'm currently a Data Analyst in a social media marketing agency and am looking to do an advanced degree in Data Science. Unfortunately, my non-technical background (I'm a liberal arts major who happens to be good at Math) means that I don't have the prerequisite undergraduate courses needed for Masters degrees in Data Science. However, I fit the profile of some Masters in Business Analytics/Management Analytics degrees. These courses combine business concepts with coding components, with introductory overviews into ML & AI, but they're not deep, technical specializations. Was wondering if you'd say it would be a relatively smooth journey from a Business Analytics Masters degree to an eventual Data Scientist role?\n",
      "2442 Thanks for sharing Ken \n",
      "2443 So, I am not making most of the beginner mistakes. But I have one question Ken. I don't know enough. Should i see the projects on YouTube and try to implement them by copying and understanding them? And you told about plagiarism in DS. Will it be like I plagiarized those projects ??\n",
      "2444 I'd personally recommend watching some free videos on a topic on yt before enrolling in a course. This way you can easier choose a good course because you already know what to look for, and since you already know some basics as you watched that free stuff, the material sinks in better because you are repeating it again while watching the course you chose (plus you get a different angle on the topic). As you say and I can confirm (from a PhD perspective) ;) getting more then one point of view is important. People have a bias and some things are obvious for one person while difficult for another, the choice of words is very important too. Mine main problem is I like theory too much plus I tend to start too many topics at once. I get too impatient and can start NLP topics even though I should be doing e.g. clustering, and NLP is not on the plan for the next few months at least. This has some advantages too (not only bad sides!) - when I get to NLP it's not all new and sinks in better, but me doing that makes the whole process chaotic. Well, I try to pat myself on the back that - in the end - if I fill all the knowledge gaps - it's not that important in what order I did it... Still I know I need more order and systematic approach. And more practice. Other issue with learning DS, or every new thing really, is that you don't know how long it will take you (coz it's new to you and you don't know it so how can you plan how long it will take if you don't even know what are all the things you must learn... if it makes any sense). So - yeah, don't get crazy about deadlines, just focus on the progress. Another pro-tip - browse job offers to see what the companies want. I think this may be area and industry specific - in my area they want people good with databases, Hadoop, Spark and other Big data associated things more then they want Deep Learning & AI specialists. Kinda makes sense when you think of it... So for me, on my road to Data Science, I decided to go back to my analytics job that will let me practice python&SQL more, get my bills payed ;) and practice the DS stuff in my free time (coz I can already see with the Big data things and me still needing to work on my DL skills more this can easily take another 6 months...) So yeah, some comments on Data Science learning from someone who has been learning it for about 6 months ;)\n",
      "2445 The most refreshing thing about your videos is the honesty. Almost as much as the advise. That and seeing your dad make Cameos \n",
      "2446 Yeah, The community helped me to create the learning habit. Thank you so much, Ken.\n",
      "2447 Great video as always, Ken! & definitely the right choice :D @1:28\n",
      "2448 Hey Ken, have you ever thought on making a video on what is important when you are in a data science role already. Would be quite interesting for me to hear your opinion. I sometimes do not know if I should dive VERY deep into some specific topics or just use my freetime to learn something somewhat related. For example I love working with REST Apis and even some Vue Frontend stuff which will not make me a better data scientist, but are also fun... Since I am also a content creator I something think the same way about creating videos. Whats your opinion?\n",

      "2451 Hi! I like watching your videos. Love and support from India There's some thing in particular that I'd like to ask. 1) It's been some time since I completed MySQL course. However i have gone through the videos a few times but still I am not able to gain the confidence of saying that I know SQL. What do you suggest here? 2) Practical knowledge is very important and I am unable to get that. I have a dataset. I make up problem statements in my mind and try solving it. But that is clearly not helping at all. So can you suggest me some places where I can apply the knowledge of Sql that I gained through the course? Course I took: 365 Data Science.\n",
      "2452 Excellent Insights! I totally agree with the point of not applying your knowledge and focusing only on theory as being one of the biggest hurdle for someone new in the field.\n",

I check nearly all the boxes for the basic data scientist you described, so I appreciate the advice on how to differentiate ones self. \n",
      "2454 Those are spot on . These are few of the mistake I made when I was starting\n",
      "2455 Mistake I personally made, I didn't learn enough math. And I thought that I could brute force my way through a data science course with some hodgepodge math. I think really getting that foundation is pretty important and it can be done in a singular course, it doesn't have to be a year of university math classes\n",

      "2489 Hi Ken , understanding it as you talk . keep talking . \n",
      "2490 why do we want to program for data science. We need to make that clear. Data Science and ML is all about finding patterns and predicting results. Once you get the results then use anything to make that result work. I'm really fed up of hearing R is not flexible, R is not programmer friendly. But does it get the job done, yes, then where's the argument. This trend started when programmers got to believe they can do ML and DS\n",
      "2491 Thank you!.\n",
      "2492 Truth = Truth, if one is willing to accept it. FYI Ken you just kicked many people in the *****.\n",

      "2494 Hey, Can you suggest me what should I do to become an well trained in field of data science ? I don't have any coding background. I watched lots of video related to #Roadmaps about learning ML,DL, AI, or any programming language. I started watching video of @Krishna naik and @Tina Huang . what should I do first ? Currently I'm started learning python, along with this I need to improve my coding skills. As a beginner, how I improve my coding skills? which specific Part I need to focus? What should I do to stay motivated while studying ? Because I'm switching my career from a manufacturing sector to IT sector. please suggest me a proper ways to achieve target in optimal time.\n",
      "2495 I tried this project on google colab. I have used images of animals data to image assistant batch image downloader for downloading images. Also, FAST AI is a really cool repo for this. As always thank you Ken for the video...\n",
      "2496 Hey Ken awesome video, there is so much (sometimes conflicting) information out there about data science, it's nice to see you break it down. I just got admitted to Tufts for a master in data science with thesis. My undergrad is in electrical engineering. Just wondering if you know anything about the Tufts programs or would know what to anticipate in terms of career outcomes after graduation?\n",
      "2497 4:35 funny thing... that's the solution\n",

      "2507 Matlab is still used a lot. It is not outdated. It just is not really for statistics and data science. It is still an important tool for engineers, the basic sciences and mathematicians. Still would not recommend it for data science, unless you expect to work in engineering and colleagues use it a lot. It is just too expensive to justify it, unless you know your employer will gladly pay for it (and all the separate toolboxes).\n",
      "2508 hi sir. Is it possible to get a freelance data science job even tough I only have a bootcamp and no experience at all. I'm planning to shift to data science career but as of now I can't risk to resign on my current job so I'm planning to have a frealance/work from home job before becoming fulltime on DS. Any suggestions on how to get a freelance job or On the Job Training? THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR HELP!\n",

      "2513 Very interesting\n",
      "2514 Hey Ken :) Thank you for all the amazing content. I've been binging this past week, since finding your channel. I have some constructive criticism. I've noticed that the mixing is frequently \"off\" when you're interviewing someone. Your volume is typically leveled higher than the guest's, which makes it difficult to consume, without having the volume dial at the ready, to live mix. Regardless, I appreciate you and the work you've done for this community!\n",
      "2515 I enjoy LinkedIn. I now need to keep \"Cold Emailer\" in my job search skill set. I did initially try the \"Spray and Pray\" method (failed w/ lots of applications). So, the other two is definitely the \"Go-To.\"\n",

      "2517 I finished interview for a computer vision engineer. It's been 7 days and I'm just waiting for an email or call telling me if I got it or not. Previously I spoke to a recruiter at Facebook and AWS They never got back to me. It can be discouraging to apply and just get ghosted.\n",

      "2524 Interesting data :)\n",
      "2525 I love to use cold emails/messages to network. When i first started doing this it was so weird. What I found was offering some type of value to the person was best to gain traction and also have a better feeling myself knowing that I wasn't just using this new person as a resource only. New relationships can be mutually benefiical for both parties and it shouldn't just be one-way! Great content as always Ken!\n",

      "2529 If I understood the article correctly this is only for US and Canada. As a European I think the data may differ drastically due to the job market culture. In my opinion here Universities are the most popular and even maybe the only way to get into the field if you want companies to look at you seriously. It's just my opinion, bit I am pointing this out for your international viewers just in case.\n",

      "2531 I've been watching you since last year, and the production quality has improved drastically! I'm happy to see this channel grow :D\n",
      "2532 I think if you want to go the cold-call email route, a nice python automation script might cut down a lot of time. You should be able to scrape a lot of companies' email addresses and then send out emails to them with your CV. This can be repeated or done once-off? Or would it be better to cater each email to the comany that you send it to?\n",
      "2533 From opinion likedin would be better option because normal job application goes through resume software which get rejected mostly so networking with people on LinkedIn engaging and making connections and talking to potential recruiter will be best choice but bad side of cold email is getting those mail people sometimes spam those which is totally not cool ....these are my opinion of course other people can have there own as well\n",
      "2534 So insightful \n",
      "2535 Wow... Right video at right time This will help me while apply for data science jobs Great article Jeremie Harris Thanks...\n",

I understand the logic but whenever I try doing something, I am unable to recall the correct syntax. 2. How do I overcome the fear of losing this epic jump?

The course offers other additional programming languages like Java, C, SQL etc. So shall I go for it? Or will there be extra unnecessary knowledge that has nothing to do with data science?\n",

      "2608 Just a couple of comments on this excellent video: For Challenge 4: Actually I'd said find the COMPANIES you'd like to go in order to decide what you want to learn. Try to learn as much as you can from them, and not just their recruitment process. Now, I have yet to find a data science job but I've been around in the job hunting department. There's nothing that puts off an employer more than someone in an interview knowing nothing about the company (I've been there!) ... the reverse is also true, there's nothing more compelling for a prospective employer than an canditate who not just put out the work on their skills but on knowing the company (i've been there too!). It show commitment and the right kind too! As for the continued learning part, I've learned (duh!) that it something that you need to do constantly for a good life anyways ... no matter what job or hobby you like to do. I probably cited the following quotes a 1000 times in my entourage and probably here too but listen (possibly again): \"We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence then is not an act but an habit!\". You'll find out that this quote holds true not just for data science but also ... anything really in life really. It is also why challenge like #66daysofdata are valuable ... and not just for you professional career but, again ... for anything you want to do really. There is a metric tons of things to say about habit formation and, again, I still stand by the methods of stephen guise (which really work well!), but the gist of it is actually quite simple: work on making your habit sustainable long term before trying to put in massive loads of work. if you do the latter, chances are high you'll burn out (fast!). Do the former, and your brain and body will slowly adjust and adapt to that new habit you're trying to form. PS: The variance is quite around the 66 mean to form a new habit. Some can take almost 215 days to form and others can take hold in as little as 12 days!! (I've been there on both front!) But, as they say, your mileage may vary!! Safe journey and good luck everyone :o)\n",
      "2609 Thank you for the great video as always Ken. The grit aspect towards the end really speaks to me as someone trying to enter into the field. I remembered when I first started out going into this field my first year at UC Davis, I felt a major hit of imposter syndrome. It all really started out with when I interviewed for a Data Science project for the Data Science club at UC Davis. The president at the time (who interviewed me) asked questions about my project experience, interest in sports (this was a sports analytics project that required computer vision to analyze the movements of players), last book I read, project experience, and my SAT math score. As I answered those questions, he didn't like many answers to any of them (never had projects because I just learned how to code from my Introductory Python course I took the quarter before the interview, not into sports, stupidly said the last book I read was \"To Kill a Mockingbird\" even though it was a book about Robert Kennedy (I was kind of nervous here), and I scored in the 600 range for math) and proceeded to say this, \"Look Jeffrey, I know there's way smarter people than you. Tell me, what makes you stand out?\" My response was, \"Uh... I'm willing to work,\" and he said, \"*sigh* Everyone's willing to work.\" I basically failed the interview and he basically implied that this field isn't for me (to add insult to injury, I saw someone do better than me at the interview right after I finished). Not only that, some people thought that I would end up at McDonald's after I graduated. To compensate, I did side projects throughout sophomore year, got accepted into Facebook's Data Science mentorship called the Facebook Data Challenge 2020, secured a summer internship as a Data Analyst at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, got accepted into the MURPPS Research Program at UC Davis, and I'm on my way to prepare for an interview for a Bioinformatics Research Position in the Molecular and Cell Biology department at UC Davis to use machine learning models to predict the structure of DNA/RNA to determine how this can lead toward genetic diseases. I'm glad that having developed a sense of grit throughout the years has been so far useful for not only proving people wrong, but also giving me great opportunities.\n",

      "2616 Great advice, Ken. As someone trying to break into the field from a MS Math, I agree the entry level market is oversaturated, though a lot of candidates are unqualified. MSDS programs (which seem to dictate which skills are \"trending\") put emphasis on data viz & ML in Python (pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, scikit-learn) but from what I've seen in job postings, very few data roles use these. Outside of FAANG, where ML operations are critical, most companies need analysts (SQL, Tableau) or SWEs to build pipelines. Creating Jupyter notebooks and applying scikit-learn is a very narrow, high-supply-low-demand skillset. There is a 2020 MIT article suggesting 1 in 10 companies benefited from ML efforts. I think it's important to learn skills that are trending once you're in the field, but until then it's better to learn skills that are in high demand (SQL, Tableau, cloud services). This is what I'm dedicating my time to now.\n",

Yet, I still refuse to give up on the good life even if it means settling to be a data analyst or some other computer science job like software engineering, data engineering, DBA, etc. If I want the good life, quitting is not an option.\n",

Specially since my college classes are not tech related, since I study political science, but I want to incorporate data science tools into political analysis, so having a schedule of 1h of learning and coding everyday is helping so much! I might not become a data scientist per se, but I really believe that with consistency and perseverance I will be able to learn the skills by the end of the year! \n",

      "2635 It's can very well be a \"who you know\" industry as well. (As many are) A friend of mine got a job as a data scientist because a company didn't really know what a data scientist is capable of, but through conversations with someone at the company, explaining what he's learning and able to do they brought him in on a 6 month contract to test the waters. His work resulted in the company finding inefficiencies in their supply chain that went completely unnoticed for over a decade.

      "2756 Hello, I am struggling to choose a major. I have attained my associate of science transfer degree and need to choose a major. I think I am interested in an information science and data analysis program, but the requirements say you must already have a previous \"skill set\" with python, java, oracle, and linux, or similar to each of those. I am a first gen college student so I am extremely unfamiliar with everything basically. The counselors don't provide any helpful info about specific majors. So, can you tell me, am I supposed to study these on my own, and then apply? Do most people learn on their own, and then apply for majors involving them? I was always under the impression that most people take college courses/gain credits for these but apparently it's wrong? Isn't college for finding what you enjoy too?

In the past was difficult to keep track of how an athlete was responding to the training loads, how was sleeping, how was recovering with all the variables that differ from gender to position in the game (or sport). It's fascinating to see how some products and the Data Science applied have helped organizations, coaches, and athletes to find the invisible reasons for bad performance or injury :) On that, I think that the psychological component it's not being evaluated, which could be a great area to focus too! #66daysofdata\n",

Was thinking I might start searching for internships once I only have a few classes left so that I might finish the degree during the internship.\n",
      "2976 Focusing on one language at a time. I feel. I had to go back and forth between Python and R because of internship and coursework which made it take longer to build on understanding.

These would be great topics that I believe could add significant value. Thanks again for being transparent!\n",

I am most likely going to be doing an undergraduate for computer science at ubc. I wanted to ask if you have any advice for me as I am starting my journey in one year. I also wanted to add that I find your content very helpful and hope that everything goes well with you.\n",
      "2981 ALTERNATE QUESTION: If you were starting from scratch today, but with the knowledge of your regrets and struggles (keeping in mind that everything has changed since you began and continues to evolve) how would you proceed? More specifically, how would you \"learn Python\"? With so many ways it can be applied, it's like saying \"learn to use a computer\".\n",
      "2982 My biggest obstacle is that companies have a hard on for prior experience. If you havent done a project with their specific technology stack then they look elsewhere even if youre the better data scientist or data engineer, whatever you want to call it, in terms of learning new things, being motivated, taking pride in your work, etc.\n",
      "2983 I'm on the way of data scientist, kaggle python learned, now I'll again learn python from utube videos, than ml and neural network deep network and side wise kaggle projects. So how's my plan sir\n",
      "2984 I'm just now starting a library info science masters with a certificate of advance study in data science with a full ride. I am def nervous and hope I can follow through with the data courses. I wish I knew more about how to get by in these data science courses bv I'm worried about maintaining a GPA for scholarships.\n",
      "2985 Like 108\n",
      "2986 Greatly explained My regrets : - structured my studies and followed it religiously . - always changing resources and not sticking to one. - wished I knew before that working as intern in startup that your role doens't define what work you will working in a startup can be bug Hassel and proper guidance is something which lacks but of course you get a lot of knowledge in these experiences.\n",
      "2987 I believe we usually tend to choose an optimal strategy based on our present situation, whose benefits are only seen on the long term. For example in Morocco, I have to get a Master's Degree, but online courses, assignments and exams take all my time and energy .. Yet I can't just decide to study DS at home and not pursue a Master's Degree because I won't qualify for most job offers. At the same time, pursuing Economic Analysis and Modelling is what introduced me to DS .. Although studying free a home would have saved me so much time, money and effort, I'm not sure I'd follow that path if I wasn't already formally stuyding .. I also believe that you wouldn't bother us today on YouTube if you were socially active in University or studied just one Degree :3 so as you said, I'm Glad things turned out the way there are now\n",
      "2988 And the spamming begins now\n",
      "2989 I was also confused between R and Python but I started learning Python because the jobs or work which I want to do is more in Python Hey, If you don't mind I have one question... Why you learned C, Java as you are in data science? 66daysofdata is a nice community What are the different ways of documenting the journey? Like YouTube videos or blogs. Anything else you can suggest? Literally I'm also regreting not doing projects during college and I was also failed to utilise my lockdown time.

Is data collection supposed to be a one-time process or does it have to be repeated over when the data in the source has changed? Taking the example of glassdoor, the data around salary will change over time, so how do we decide how often we should re-collect the data? And what if the website structure changes so often and hinders the scraping process? For example, this data scrapper code we referenced doesn't work very well if I run it now as many locators have changed, so I would also have to keep up with the changes in the glassdoor web structure. How to mitigate this problem?\n",

I have been doing some research but I am not aware of any tool that allows me to do something similar to that. I found some research papers but they had too much math and they were too complex to build my app from that. Are you aware of some framework or any tool that allows me to do something like that? Or do you think that I need to make new algorithms? Also, do you have any tips on how to make it a profitable Saas? Thank you, Daniel P.S.

Im currently choosing between majoring in CS at Penn State or data science at Purdue. Do you think the name recognition and internship opportunities at Purdue could outweigh the potential drawbacks, or should I just stick to CS at a less impressive school? Also, the data science program at Purdue is relatively new, and students say many of the classes are similar to those a CS major takes. The main difference is that CS majors learn software engineering while DS majors learn statistics and data analysis. Thanks, Siyoung Kim\n",

Another example could be year over year SG stats at the same tournament held at the same course. How are course conditions and weather factored into a players SG score.

I kept pushing it back cause in my head i wanted to code the whole thing from scratch - now I'm thinking, will that be worth it seeing how i can use platforms like wix instead.. but also, i don't have that much data science work to display (i'm a computer science graduate with a few ds courses and projects) so maybe making it from scratch will be another way to showoff my work in itself? It's gonna be way more work so I'm wondering now which option should I do :/\n",

When I try to follow ur way to code, I found an easier way to do that in 14:22, which is in \"In [12]\" (the heatmap part). Actually we can order the data by \"df.sort_values(by=['Q1', 'Q6'])\" before we plot the heatmap.\n",

I try to squeeze every ounce of work with data that I can right now, but am constantly met with hurdles... Looking forward to getting back to data!\n",
      "3277 Interesting analysis! Another factor to consider is the content of the videos themselves. Your videos cover various topics like data science as a study / career path, project demos (like this one), and work / life suggestions. So, is there a coloration between the content of the videos (factoring in some of the other influences) and the response metrics? And while you are taking into consideration which days you post videos, have you considered simply posting on a particular day routinely? Lastly, are you LOSING subscribers and are there any suggestions, if this is occurring, as why this is happening? Keep up the good work!! Looking forward to a follow-up video (if I just haven't gotten to it yet).\n",

      "3316 These are pretty solid tips. I went through a similar journey since I'm already working and need structured learning. In 2017, I looked at MS CS and MS Data Science programs under $20K that are still decent. What I've seen is Georgia Tech OMSCS ($8,000), Illinois University MS Data science ($21,000), and Indiana University MS Data Science ($21,000). I failed with my application to Illinois. I got into OMSCS, I failed my 1st 2 classes and, projected to stay here for a long time. The average class students take is around 1.2 subjects/sem, with a failure rate of about 45%. I'm finishing up my IU MS Data Science, and hard to find a job still. What I got is Data Visualization and Management at Ernst and Young (and a lot of my cohorts are still struggling to find work, but easy to get an internship). If you get into Ga tech OMSCS, it's easier to find job. OMSCS is data science heavy degree. Subjects include ML, AI, HCI, Computer Vision, ML for Trading, etc. We even have AI TA's with top-notch teachers and cohorts.\n",
      "3317 Im on day 10. The hardest part so far is being patient! I just want to be able to learn everything at once and start a new career path in this field!! I wish I wouldve found this 13 years ago but at 31 I feel like I still have enough time to make a fun, and rewarding career out of this!! Channels like this are really helping me immerse myself in all things data science related right now so I can absorb everything I can!\n",
      "3318 I started learning data science due to the hype created in the market. I forced myself to take interest cuz everyone was doing it. I watched a lot of tutorial, read blogs, made account on kaggle, read research paper on GAN, open ai and list goes on. But still somewhere all this wasn't much appealing and interesting as it was appearing before entering into it. I realized I was not very interested in statistics and probability. And these are the prerequisites to get into this field. So I tried software engineering and got into web development. Today I find it more interesting that data science and I really enjoy the process of building new project and coming up with ur own idea. Unlike data science where u have to spend hours cleaning data and training models. So I recommend everyone to give a try to every field out there, don't follow the herd mentality and explore it, read about it and then decide what's suits you and stick to it.\n",

      "3331 In my opinion Ken you're introvert and that's why job with a lot of contact with people didn't suit you well. In big five scale in my opinion you're high in openess, low in agreableness, high in concienciousness and probably more introverted. In MBTI scale it would be INTJ type. This would explain why you don't like managing people but rather choose your own path and improve yourslelf. You also have strong analytical skills and this is your the most powerfull trait. Hovever I can be wrong becouse my statments are based only on your videos.\n",

      "3496 Hi. Thanks for your review, but it seems like unfair to compare Apple to orange . Where python is general language with general purpose , unlike R which is a niche programming language otherwise a statistical mathematical language. R is specific that what makes it better than any other language while dealing with analysis. Also R is faster while dealing with large data, the more the data is big the more is faster. Unlike python which get slower with larger data. Also the number of contributions and packages is far bigger than python if we compare them in the niche of data science statistics etc.. Visualisation same things while R is the market standard for official productions, I think there is #rstats on Twitter where folks publish there artistic visualisations, also I guess the (TidyTuesday) contest where community provides weekly data for challenges and contributions. Machine learning, users can use R as interface to Tensorflow/keras and pytoch and more, also, a tones of ml packages comes a long to perform complex models. If you are a developer dealing sometimes with data I suggest you to stay with python . Otherwise data analysts and researchers should pick-up R and stick to it. Every language is important, know what you need to achieve first. Than choose what is most comprehensive language that will fulfill ur need and don't rush yourself much.\n",
      "3497 Wooooo... That model of counting push-up is interesting. As there is a lot to learn in data science field but at the same time due to it's diversity a confusion is there.

I am at the intermediate level in Data Science and have done a couple of projects and have become quite comfortable tackling beginner/intermediate problems, however I feel that my coding skills are very limited to DS, do you think I should learn new skills (ex; web development), or do you think sticking to DS related coding is enough to get me into the industry? My second question is how deep into the math behind the ML algorithms should I go and understand, especially when it comes to more complicated models (and deep learning models). If my goal is to become a business oriented data scientist (and maybe a sports analyst), Is a basic understanding of the math behind models enough ? Thanks for all the hard work\n",

I have a blog where I post all my visuals of my data analytics and it's picked up great traction! However I want to do data analytics for soccer full time but I don't know what the best route is. Either go back to school and get analytics degree or taking an online course/certification for all the soccer analytic knowledge I need. Any insight or advice for what route is better?\n",

Businesses hire people to solve problems, generate sales, reduce costs, improve customer satisfaction, etc. All of these things can be quantified to some degree. At a minimum, put some focus on how your project adds value to the organization. Position yourself as not just a data scientist or ML engineer, but also a value-add problem solver and business advisor. You're not in academia, you're in business.\n",

I have started my journey towards it and almost there to do my own projects (Started doing projects on Kaggle). I have work placement on 3rd year. By then I hope to have some projects done on my own. But I doubt companies hire an undergrad for data science role. I have heard that they prefer master's student. What's your say in this? I don't want to change my career path now.\n",

Prolly will switch back to international commercial law xD\n",
      "3701 The last question could be understood as if you were fishing for feedback, hence might indicate lack of confidence or even a lack of understanding to the position you are interviewing for. After all, you have supposedly done your homework and established a strong link between your knowledge, set of skills and the open position, the company's vision, goals, etc. In other words, how would you add value to the company if you still do not understand how your skills and expertise align with their expectations? As an interviewer, I'd view that question in a negative light. But there are ways around it and you can still get that sort of feedback indirectly. Apart from that, great video and great tips from you as always. Keep it up.\n",

      "3709 Hi Ken, Thanks so much for your videos; I find them really encouraging and instructive. I am wondering, how does the intuition we build about the data inform how we set up the models? If feels like there was a bit of a disconnect there, and right now if feels like I just turn on these black box models and get a prediction with little understanding of the variables ... Thanks!\n",
      "3710 Hi Ken, I am regularly watching your channel now and thanks for lots of great videos. I have recently declared double major on DS. And, my current fear is that I have encountered lots of data scientists saying that ds requires solid understanding in math. I have already took Calc 1 and 2. However, it was a while ago, so i believe i need to restudy them. And, I still need to take a stats course and linear algebra. So, im currently wondering how strong of math do I need to know if I want to go into the field? Or, how in depth do i need to know of math? For ex, would I need just basic understanding of calculus, stats and linear algebra. Or, do I need to know them solidly by knowing good enough to take honors or higher courses in that I can implement them however I want and solve bunch of Olympiad level questions? Also, would it be okay for me to learn math through online courses or books to acquire skills, or do I need to take courses from a college in order to show that I have taken courses? Thank you as always and rly hope that you can give me some insights on these.\n",
      "3711 I strongly agreed that university curriculum is a good reference for study guideline. I personally use the CMU ML program's curriculum and search related python, R or Java related projects to practice at the same time. Very decent and practical advices for data learning.

I think it is incredibly valuable to see your approach to learning a new Python package - especially to those new to the field that are struggling with imposter syndrome. Googling and seeing how other people have tackled a problem/project you are working on (and even using some of their code) is perfectly fine and in lots of cases probably the most efficient way of learning a new data analysis method/skill/etc. I can't wait for the logical next iteration of this style of video - livestreaming your work!\n",

For example, there are some datasets (like Kaggle's Titanic) in which I could create a pretty accurate regression model in just a few lines of code, but that obviously doesn't seem like enough to include in a portfolio. Further, if I'm taking an online machine learning course, and there are 'projects' given but solutions to those projects given as well, I'm assuming that those projects wouldn't be wise to include in a portfolio?\n",

I haven't completed a degree and currently have 5 years of experience working IT on government contracts. Is it recommended that I finish my degree in something on the business side such as finance, learn SQL/python/stats and try to land a BI role? Or should I go ahead and pursue a science degree such as a bachelor's of science in CS? Goal is BI/DA --> MLE/DS one day\n",
      "3850 Thank yoy for the very informative videos. I would add the following advice, which I wish someone had told me: while following courses or reading books in the Data Science learning process, we will be doing tiny projects. There will be a tendency to focus on the learning and not on the packaging of one's work. By packaging I mean: cleaning your code, properly commenting it, basically making it into a notebook you could publish, not into a code that just does the job. So, there is a tendency to produce drafts for these projects in the learning process, instead of final versions. And the assumption is that at that moment learing is the goal, and that at some later moment we will convert these into final portfolio projects, when we have more time that we can spare and dedicate to the cosmetics part. But then you end up a few of months later with a lot of small project drafts to finalize and the task of refactoring and documenting so many projects will seem daunting and you'll keep postponing it. Therefore, my advice is: dedicate some time during this learning process to finalizing and publishing your work, resist the temptation of pushing this task further into the future. There won't be a 'right' time.\n",

This would cost 6,768 in tuition as I have an Alumni discount. The curriculum is: Trimester one: Programming for Problem Solving Introduction to AI Trimester two: Data Analytics and Visualisation Applied AI in Business Trimester three: Dissertation Project My question is, would it be better to build my own curriculum through Coursera or take the Data 365 course? We are in our 3rd lockdown here in the UK and I have a 3 year old son, so trying to figure out what is the best (and most cost effective!) way to learn. Thank you if you have read this far!\n",

Generally, going from fewer skills to more skills is desirable, but going from \"fat\" aka something negative to \"skinny\" aka an admirable goal...just isn't universal, and it can be unhelpful to present it as such. A more constructive way to present this example could be about taking care of one's health, whatever that looks like for different people. It's my impression that Data Science as a field is trying to be more inclusive, and I believe weight inclusivity needs to be part of that. Thanks for reading if you did!\n",

It's funny because the training was funded for underemployed individuals..to help them transition to a new career. ALSO, it had 0 programming. I happen to know coding, but I've done no programming projects in this program. My first step for 2021 is to learn if I can actually be attractive to employers with this learning (Tableau, RapidMiner, KNIME, Alteryx) and to find a source of temporary income, while I figure this out.\n",
      "3925 Hello Ken! Thanks for the content! I recently moved from Brazil to Saint Charles (about 1h from Chicago) so as to stay with my wife and thought that pursuing a masters, instead of only self learning, could give me an edge when looking for a job here. I graduated in Industrial Engineering and am pursuing a masters in data science, preferably in the Chicago area. Is pursuing a masters a good idea given that I do not currently have a diploma that local employers would recognize? How much does the prestige of the university matter for professional outcome? What is, in your opinion, best for professional outcome? An online but more prestigious degree or an on site but less prestigious degree? In Brazil there is prejudice against online learning. What are your thoughts on University of Illinois at Chicago and Illinois Institute of Technology in general, but also regarding their Business Analytics and Data Science masters ? Given that I have what I believe could be considered a \"technical background\" what do you believe would be important in a masters in data science? Hard or soft skills? How was your experience at DePaul? Quality of classes and professional outcome wise. Sorry for this avalanche of questions. Hope you can answer them as I believe it would be of great help. Thank you!\n",
      "3926 My biggest hurtle seems to be the degree. TL;DR - Due to the Department of Veteran Affairs, I effectively can no longer get a Bachelors in the U.S. (without first having tens of thousands, and at that point I could transfer my first 109 credits), so Ive been learning a lot of the math on the side. Programming Ive been doing since I was a child, but Ive still a lot to learn to become a data scientist in other aspects. Anyone who may know, Im intrigued, in your experience, approximately what percentage of data scientists do you know who hold no degree? I imagine not a lot. But then again, Id finish my degree if I could, too. \n",
      "3927 Excited that everyone is so excited. Would be happy to follow along in other data tools with this project. I'm sort of a one man band at the moment so time is a constraint, due to this constraint I don't use R/Python as much as I used to instead I use data science tools like Alteryx and viz tools like Power BI/Tableau. Looking forward to follow along and try this out with a different toolset. Cheers\n",

I suspect some people may now be reluctant to like a comment as it may detract from their own comment. Maybe there should have been a blind benchmark for a period of time before announcing the leaderboard. I suppose people could prove me wrong by liking this comment. Checkmate.\n",
      "4006 Reviewing the processing code that others have written has exposed a significant issue. Whether the original dataset is already in a \"sanitized\" state or in need of cleaning, reorganization, or transformation a lot of the existing \"notebooks\" show there is little to no evidence of getting to know and understand the data before these examples jump to the exploratory data analysis stage. This boils down to blindly accepting the dataset without question. Is the data accurate? What is the source of the underlying data? Perhaps an over reliance on so-called curated or well-known datasets is the underlying cause of this phenomenon. Some people, including instructors, claim the exploratory data analysis stage is when you learn about the dataset. In my opinion and based on experience, the exploratory data analysis stage is supposed to be time evaluate whether the data is suitable for the particular question(s) that instigated the project. Prior to EDA is the time to understand the raw data itself but not whether it can potentially answer those questions. The rush to model building exposes another serious deficiency in the way data science of taught - is the goal of the project to explain historical data or predict future outcomes when presented with new data - is the data skewed or is it relatively normally distributed or should the data be normalized or weighted - is a model necessary? The curated datasets have a place in learning data science. However, too often they instill lemming-like cookie-cutter behaviour. Use these datasets to learn a concept but avoid making them part of a portfolio or treating them as a best practise for real projects. If you want to use them to document your data science learning journey that is fine but at least be creative in the way such datasets are presented - consider demonstrating how a seemingly obvious but incorrect/inappropriate machine learning technique can lead to useless, if not erroneous, conclusions and/or models, and state the reason(s) this technique is inappropriate; consider something other than Python and R to process the data, maybe SQL is adequate; consider integrating other data sources so what-if scenarios can be performed, ideally interactively by end-users. For example, what if data about iceberg flows and the route of the HMS Titanic were added to the model, could the collision have been avoided while still reaching New York City in record time? This might require simulated data based on historical data or modelled using knowledge of ocean currents, fluid dynamics, iceberg and ice fields formation and physical characteristics, weather conditions, etc. Think critically about the data and what if anything it can teach us. Ask the difficult questions and attempt to answer them.\n",

      "4048 Hi Ken. I just opened up my course work for my master's program in Data Science from the University of Denver and I am on red alert! The bridge math courses are so intense that I feel like I may be in over my head. The calculus bridge course essentially covers calculus from limits all the way up to multivariate calculus and beyond (4 to 5 calculus courses) in a span of 10 weeks! Their discrete math and linear algebra combine these two disciplines as well. I may switch to Eastern University's program which is much less math intensive and can be completed in 10 months. Do you think companies will really care where I get my degree from? I enjoy math, but not at such a pace that I will have difficulty retaining any of it. The fact that I end up spending over 95% of my time using outside resources to even begin to understand how to do the homework assignments leads me to believe this may not be a very well structured program and that I might as well drop this master's program and switch to a different one.\n",
      "4049 I'm interested in shifting my career to \"Data Science\" & I need an advice from an expert in the field after watching good amount of your Youtube videos. I moved to Illinois, Chicago 7 months ago from Jordan. I've been in the Marketing field for over 5 years & I decided this isn't the field that I wish to continue perusing. Since a lot of companies require Master's degree as a minimum requirement for a Data Scientist position. I conducted MSc programs search that would have low entry requirements considering that I come from Business major, and I came across \"Eastern University\" Data Science Accelerated (7 Weeks) Online MSc, which I applied to & waiting a response from the admission office. I compared the curriculum to other universities, & I noticed that Cloud Computing & Algorithms are not covered. My Question: If I proceed with this low entry barrier University (If Accepted) considering my lack of technical knowledge coming from a Business Major (Learning Python & SQL on my own) - Will I be able to land a job after finishing the program? since the university isn't well recognized or hiring relies on sharpened skills? - Does the curriculum cover the needed practical knowledge on the job? - What are the areas/topics that you see important and are not listed in the curriculum? Below are the information of the program, if you could spare 15 minutes of your time to give me a candid opinion. - https://www.eastern.edu/academics/colleges-seminary/college-health-and-sciences/departments/department-mathematical-5 - https://www.eastern.edu/academics/graduate-programs/ms-data-science Thank you & Happy Holidays\n",

      "4146 Before delving into machine learning I recommend aspiring data scientists hone data cleaning and exploratory data analysis skills. Data familiarization and cleaning being foundational skills. There are smallish datasets that are appropriate for beginners and which can be visually scanned to confirm the findings reported. For example, the automobile fuel efficiency dataset available from UCI contains 'marked' missing values for some numeric data, data entry mistakes primarily in the make and/or model; not every make and model combination is present more than one year, and two fuel types are present. The data source makes available the original dataset as well as a subset still requiring further cleaning, along with a codebook describing the data and each variable. Many instructors tell you to begin by plotting the data but this approach has two problems: you do not know if there are any missing values or other incorrect values which can lead to plots which are erroneous or simply cannot be rendered; and you have not spent sufficient time understanding the raw data and the types of questions it might be able to answer.\n",

Also - maybe eventually appear on your YT Channel as a successful transition to DS story ;) I have many ideas for DS projects, but they all need some more research (some including IP & compliance research - hey, I used to work as something like a ISO/FDA compliance officer for a while, I kinda like this stuff? I certainly don't mind it... I found some courses on Coursera about those topics... I am not ruling out taking those courses in 2021. Engineers that are willing to get involved with those topics are rare, so familiarity with such issues can be very valuable to employer... it is just an idea at this point, no decisions have been made). I also need to take some deep dive on deep learning and some machine learning algorithms. I ABSOLUTELY need to browse & learn from other people's DS projects more. It's very inspiring too ;) I am looking forward to the new 66 Days of Data (why 66? why not 69? ;) or any other number?)\n",
      "4165 1) Start with a plan. That's what I need to do now. I've been jumping around too much. I was interviewing for a couple of months with one company and had a few coding tests that inspired me to focus on those subjects. Then I got the form letter of doom. Now I need to look at what I want to do and refocus. Thanks for the inspiration and the motivation.\n",
      "4166 In 66 days, iLL be a great DS and a working in a big company in korea\n",
      "4167 Great stuff! Just one thing I'd like to start here: As a post graduate in Maths, I'd like to point out that Stats is a separate degree and we math majors don't really study stats and vice versa ( a lot of industry misconception around this). Although stats is basically Mathematics, it's a separate degree. Hopefully this clears doubts, I know a lot of you watching this video would be confused as to pursuing CS or Math for your MS. Keep this comment in mind, hopefully this finds you.\n",
      "4168 Hi, Ken, I'm looking forward to 66 days! I'm still working on my Titanic competition. The previous modelling performance was only slightly better than the benchmark and then I started all over and found a few things missing from my previous work (combine the datasets first, check the types of missingness, deep understanding of each variable, etc.). So far I made three sharing notebooks(EDA, missingness, fare analysis). Through this project, I became more aware of the importance of EDA and feature engineering.\n",
      "4169 You're honestly inspiring me to self-study and learn Data Science.\n",
      "4170 Ken Jee is the Data Science hero we all need.... But never deserve.\n",
      "4171 Actually I dont understand the #66days of data, do we share our progression like everyday but each one on his own or what? If theres a video like describing it more then can anyone refer it to me. Also, I really like how you talk about overcoming the comfort zone or the fear of digging into projects cause yeah its very true.\n",
      "4172 What an amazing initiative Ken - #66daysofdata is an absolute success!!!\n",
      "4173 Hi! I am already following this series and this morning I was reading an article about a man who got an interview from the first data science job he applied for; he started his data science journey by following this series too! The article is by Mario Paul at Towards Data Science titled: \"I Got An Interview From The Only Data Science Job I applied for.\" This is so awesome!\n",
      "4174 The project I am working on a to automate my quantitative approach to investing. Using the yahoo finance api I am going to build a simple input screen with a stock that will shoot out the main factors I personally look at. Itll consist of time aeries and some basic financial formulas. Some of my friends also are interested in my project.\n",
      "4175 Another huge difference between the two videos is the editing quality\n",
      "4176 keep it up Ken! Love it!\n",
      "4177 3:51 ... \n",
      "4178 Yeah I kinda didnt deal with my imposter syndrome in the healthiest way,... I tried to just learn absolutely everything before applying for internships as an undergrad. I would just sit and cram and learn stuff thay most interns as an undergrad wouldnt need to know going in.\n",
      "4179 Thanks Ken I really hope to start this journey...my laptop is pulling me back \n",
      "4180 Communities are highly important for accountability, relationship/networking as well as finding continual inspiration and perspective from other people at different levels of data science. I highly agree.\n",
      "4181 Just came here to see what you got. I used random forest and got .76 on my first try and then a little tuning got it to .77. I think I could make it better so I will continue to play around. I got to the point in my course curriculum mid-lecture I said \"this is more advanced than I need to get started on beginner projects\" and instantly hopped off to do titanic. I had it all worked up in my head to be some super hard task but it turned out to be relatively painless! I am going to do a couple other smaller projects and then try something of my own, probably using youtube data because I am a massive geek for the algorithim.\n",
      "4182 Hi jee, I like your videos but don't think it's a good idea to put a strange picture as a cover of a video ...\n",
      "4183 Hi Ken Jee nice video.. valuable contents!.Do you think it's a good choice to go for a 10months online master in Data science?\n",
      "4184 Hey! I am thinking about creating a project about a mobile price predictor(which would be my first project), and I would be following your building a project from scratch playlist. That's my project plan for 2021. Hope everything goes well(fingers crossed).\n",
      "4185 Thanks, Ken. Good stuff.\n",
      "4186 Have u by chance heard anything about sports analytic jobs in soccer?\n",
      "4187 Thank you so much for this insightful video. Is that discord channel open to everyone?\n",

      "4189 Thank you master\n",
      "4190 Is the Tensorflow Developer Certificate worth it?\n",
      "4191 Good morning. I want to join the 66 days challenge in 2021. Please how do I follow up with the program\n",
      "4192 Hey Ken, do you have good resources for web scraping in Python to get started on projects?\n",
      "4193 Looking forward to another #66DaysOfData\n",
      "4194 Ken Jee, you are the best. I am your follower since this channel has 3k to 4k subscribers. I am happy that your channel is growing.\n",
      "4195 Part to learn and classify plants in my own garden.\n",
      "4196 Sorry but your definition is totally misleading because Artificial Intelligence is not a field of data science neither machine learning but machine learning is a subset of AI and AI is a subset Computer Science. It has been so since 1956 and has never changed. People who develop AI algorithms are computer scientists not data scientists. Just like Mathematics is not a subset of Physics, yes Data Scientists use lot of ML to solve problems but they do not generally study AI like computer scientist do. Just like physicists uses math but they do not study math like mathematicians do. You can also say so about medical professionals when comparing them to biologists. Thanks... Just wanted to highlight\n",
      "4197 Hey KeNN! Much better fashion sense in this video (and camera, microphone and monitor) :) I really have been absorbing and enjoying your videos for the past 3 months. Having a physics background and a secret fear of programming, your clear philosophical approach has been a lifesaver. I thoroughly enjoy the weekly interviews on KNN and the separate, visual content your youtube channel has to offer. It's so cool to track your growth! I have a masters in applied physics and am currently trying to land my first full-time data science gig, so I will be sure to add regression & classification projects to my github (Only have Monte Carlo & Clustering projects right now) Can't wait to see where your punny dad jokes go next!\n",
      "4198 great tips!!!\n",
      "4199 ok bro show us what we should learn in 2021 :)\n",
      "4200 LMFAO I SAY MODELS TRAINING TOO MUCH\n",
      "4201 I appreciated your video Ken! 2020 was a challenging year for me in terms of defining what to study and you helped me a lot on this! I am looking forward to starting the path I idealized and being part of your community!\n",
      "4202 Great advice and content Ken! One thing I would love to add to those seeking their first job is to ignore job titles, and be open to positions such as \"BI Analyst/Engineer, Data Analyst, etc\", especially if you are entry level for several reasons 1) I was a BI associate and had opportunities to work on ML. Companies use terms interchangeably, and I have seen \"data scientists\" who do SQL and reporting all day.. 2) If you want to be a data scientist, you'll have to work with analysts, BI people, data engineers, and stepping into their shoes will help you in the long run. In a way it's taking 1 step back to take 3 forward. and 3) People should really focus on bringing value to an organization, rather than just doing \"cool\" projects. A lot of companies aren't ready for advanced ML/AI. You will be more miserable creating a data science project which will never be put into production than creating a Tableau Dashboard that the whole business will use. Heres to a great 2021!\n",
      "4203 Ken being honest about what he struggled with, shows that every great data scientist struggled to reach where they are today. motivating and inspirational as always , thank you !\n",
      "4204 Was a Data Science Kamehameha in the thumbnail?!\n",
      "4205 I appreciate this video a lot! I'm a teenager and brand new to data science but I wanted to use your advice as a springboard to getting into it. I already bought a few of the books you recommended and I'm slowly on my way.\n",
      "4206 Thank you Ken. I'm really enjoying your videos and podcast as I begin my data science journey.\n",
      "4207 I basically never comment on videos on youtube, but I feel like I should do this now as I kinda like what I see and hear. The information seems to be very useful, thank you. I am a complete beginner, I started to learn data science a couple of months ago, 5 minutes ago I finished to review some EDA (it is a part of my course). At this moment everything seems to be so complex, I feel like I learn things really slow and I will never be good at this stuff, I hope I am wrong :) You asked about projects, in the future I'd like to make some prediction model for an esport game like Dota 2, CS:GO or so, if I make some of this in 2021 I'll be sooo happy :D p.s. pardon me my English, it's not my native language\n",
      "4208 I think a cool project I want to work on in 2021 is simulating a monopoly game. A favorite subject of mine is stochastic processes, and really, monopoly is just a giant markov chain/transition matrix. I think it'd be cool to do something like that. Still working on my main school project now which has caused a few others to be put on the back burner, but hopefully this one wraps up soon so I can focus on the others more. Great content as always. Just joined the discord!\n",

      "4210 I have been away for a while.. Good to see your channel doing so well. Although I haven't been so active recently, I personally have come a long way since the first #66daysofdata. I was looking forward to the next one, but unfortunately I don't think I will be able to participate (I kinda got to be away for quite some time). I will make sure to be on Discord whenever I can though. Good luck!\n",
      "4211 Looking forward to join you in the 66 days of data again. As a project, i want to web scrap the prices and data of a colombian e-commerce each day and show how the business behave as the country get the COVID's vaccine.\n",
      "4212 You are literally amazing. your aesthetic presentation boost me on next level in the quest of learning data science.\n",

      "4219 Hi! I am 16 right now and I got really interested in data science. Right now I am looking for a book or a lecture, which could help me to increase my Maths/programming knowledge. If there is something you can recommend me, I would be really grateful I already know Python, so maybe there is something else to learn deeper for me\n",

      "4229 Great video Ken! For 2021 I was thinking of a project that predicts the value of magic: the gathering cards on the secondary market. I'll try to combine sentiment analysis (taken from twitter) and data from online tournaments to do so. It's a greedy project, but I can use it if it works so it's a win/win haha\n",
      "4230 This is perfect timing. I'm just about to finish my master in physics and decided I'd like to transition into the data science field. I've been watching tons of your videos the last few weeks, and they helped me a lot to make the decision to become a data scientist and how to start the journey! Thanks!\n",
      "4231 Ken since you emphasize learning programming, use the term library not package. Yes, a nitpick but we should not be using cutesy terms when talking about programming and the vast collections of ready-built functions/methods. Your videos are always informative.\n",
      "4232 I understand programming (Full Stack web Development), but for Data Science is it worth getting a Masters or should I learn this skill by my self? I dont have a STEM degree, but a BA in psych\n",
      "4233 Yeah Ken! Well done! Hope all is well with you and happy holidays!\n",
      "4234 I think we all would agree that we like hearing you speak, all advices packed with practical, wholesome and nutritious food for thought. Do I smell an early sign of another viral video, great video Ken! Some of the projects that I look forward to in 2021 is to look into transformers and its application in computational drug discovery, would be awesome to reverse engineer and decode those molecular descriptors to new compounds.\n",

      "4247 There is so much free and good source out there about data science and so many ways to learn it... As someone just starting their data science journey and someone who is struggling with ADHD I was so overwhelmed and confused. If anyone is in my situation I've found \"Siraj Raval - Learn Data Science in 3 Months\" video helpful. You are not going to be a data scientist in 3 months obviously, but I think it is giving you a rough plan. It is divided into weeks and each month you do one project. Of course, I also check the resources Ken suggested and I am following a Python course on Udemy, so it is ok to mix all of the advice you see. One more advice: you can better learn a subject when you teach it. So I recommend you start a blog about your DS journey. You can take 10 mins each day and write about what you learned that day. It is also good for you to see how much you've learned over time :) Good luck everyone!\n",
      "4248 You're just the best! I started the 66 data journey with you but wasn't able to keep up, but you always motivate me, hope to be more sincere this time. A structured curriculum should be made, at least for me to be more, you know, sincere. Maybe starting with Kaggle and online courses.. So many different courses, competition, everything gets me so overwhelmed, maybe because I just look through it instead of starting, but not this time, I will make use of time! Listening to you today, made my day! Thanks, KJ Merry Christmas!\n",

I believe these boards are subject to heavy confirmation bias and anchoring. I'm going to analyze the recidivism rate of the boards, using SQL joins (which i know how to do, sort of...) and web scraping, which i don't know at all.

I think it would be cool for me to do a sort of reaction/breakdown of this video and how it relates to my journey for a more in the dirt perspective if that's ok with you.

Although I was wondering if you could show us what the k-means graph would look like at 1:34? Anyway, great vid and keep doing what you're doing.\n",
      "4276 You have some good points but the problem is that most projects require deep learning knowledge. The Kaggle courses won't teach you how deep learning really works or what the parameters do so you are just going blind.

I want to persue my career in AI and i will doing till PhD.

So nowaday there are some colleges which offer a B.Tec course in AI. So i have compared the curriculums of Both AI and CSE and what i found is if yoh are clear that you want to do AI then definitely you should take AI in B.Tec. So i have this confusion of what to do in my B.Tec, can you please help me through this. It would be really a great help to me. My only consern is that if i take CSE then the topics like ML, AI, digital fabrication, AI and Humanity, DBMS, Computer networks, robotics, etc. I will miss this all as strong base, as direct in master i will be having less time, if i opt for AI then i have a preety good amount of time, and other side it's a wide spectrum open to me if i take CSE, so this is what my prospective is so what should i choose?\n",

      "4387 When you say probability theory, what level are we talking about? Like the \"probability theory\" class at my school is calculus based and requires us to have taken Multivariable calculus beforehand. Meanwhile I know a lot of concepts in probability theory can be taught to some extent without difficult calculus problems. For example, I just recently ordered a textbook: Probability for the enthusiastic beginner by David J. Morin. It doesn't assume any prior experience with calculus. It covers Combinatorics, Probability, Expectation Values, Distributions, Gaussian Approximations, Correlation, and Regression. Does this sound sufficient?\n",
      "4388 Do I actually need to be able to solve integrals? I definitely get the calculus concepts in this video, but I just can't reliably solve anything more difficult than the integrals you do in the first 1-2 weeks of Calc 2.\n",
      "4389 Anyone remember those sites in the 2000s where you click on one link for a video, then it just goes to another page full of links and then you click a link there and it goes to another page of links and on and on. That's what this video is like.\n",

      "4396 I didn't see the video yet (but I will, after writing this). I would spend 95% of my time with software engineering topics. I wouldn't touch anything related to data science.\n",
      "4397 Hey Ken, great vid! I'm planning to specialise in Data Science as a graduate, is learning Python a good place to start? I'm relying on my college to teach me math, but I've got a lot of free time on my hands, so I'm delving into Python. Terrified and excited at the same time :)\n",
      "4398 I am trying to build a multivariate linear regression model, and trying out different combinations of variables to build my model. For example, I build a model with interactions between different variables, but another model with just main effects. My question is, when do we know that we have a solid model that is worth accessing for need of transformation? I am a little confused on what steps I should be taking to build a meaningful model.\n",
      "4399 I really love the spirit of this. I'm also really thankful you're providing the source code. I have a more traditional web app (JavaScript) background and am currently learning Data Science and Machine learning.

      "4409 This is great! I'm going to start this in the new year!\n",
      "4410 Hey Ken! Great videos, I just found you last week and have been going through your channel. I was wondering your opinion on whether or not going back to school is essential, or worth it? I am 30, with a associates of mechanical engineering that I got 10 years ago and never used. Do you think just learning these things that you have listed here without going back to complete my bachelors degree (in data science or statistics) would be enough to get me a position as a data scientist in the next 1-2 years?\n",
      "4411 Nice project idea\n",
      "4412 Great idea!!\n",
      "4413 Hey! I'm learning data science from 3 months and I have completed probability, some part of stats and python, now I'm learning Linear regression and clustering. I have not yet started with the deep learning concepts. But I want to start my project now and build the project along side the theory do u think that is a good idea? Also at this level is it good to start with this series or will I be confused as I don't know many concepts? Also I am self learner so if you would reply it would be of a great help\n",
      "4414 I strongly agree with you about the three rasons in order to not become in a data scientist but I think as you told, depends on your position or your goal. For instance, I think in the resarch area you have less collaboration because most time you are the only one that know your work or your novel investigation so it's sometimes hard to display this to others. I think there are many resources for learning data science hence the main problem to become in data scientist is the patience and self-confidence.\n",
      "4415 Thanks for insights. Lastly my motivation to learn data science dropped. Content like that helps me to motivate myself.\n",

      "4419 Side comment you made that I find really interesting. That the education was similar everywhere you went but the students were all different. Part of the reason I want to go to a master's program or top company is to surround myself with different people than my upper middle tier college (Seton Hall). Would love to see a video talking about that it even interview you on the topic.\n",

      "4508 In case it's helpful for anyone: I'm in Oregon State University's Data Analysis Program and was doing Sales (groan) before. You can either cash out halfway through for a Certificate (for about $12k) or go full Master's (for about $25k). I'm about halfway through. I tried the Udemy and self-learning approach and an actual school is totally worth the money in my eyes. The use cases you work with are more compelling and rigorously assessed than free / cheap stuff I found online. You're also bombarded with concepts each week which gives you a lot of bang for your buck; usually I learn just enough to pass the class then really try to internalize it via independent projects after. I'm planning on a more portfolio-based entryway into a position that recoups what I paid for school and whether my anecdotal advice is even worth listening to probably hinges on how successful that ends up being ;o) but thus far I have been very happy with academic learning (and I'm not someone who likes college!)\n",
      "4509 I like the last project ideas. :) It's nice how you start from scrapping and data analysis and end with AI ;) What did you do for the glassdoor project (data scraping wise) if you don't mind me asking? If I understand things correctly, if the robots.txt forbids you from scraping them, you use their API and all is cool? How is it with using youtube data for data science projects? I'm not talking about downloading videos - I'm interested in comments, video titles and thumbnails. Intuitively it should be ok to use those... Edit: I should watch the videos of the projects you reviewed for inspiration.\n",
      "4510 Ken, due to lockdown I really wasted a huge amount of time which whereas I was planning to be so productive and to master on DL. However, on that gap, I lost the knowledge I had :)) and added more to my depression and imposter syndrome. Now walking through your youtube videos (you have done quite great stuff when I was not out there ) makes me feel safe that I'm actually not that late and I can start it over, I believe that community is going to have a great impact on me!

Therefore, I start looking up about data science, and realize there are some part of data science work I already do (I just don't know it's called data science out there lol). However, there are some part I haven't touched yet (e.g. computer vision, random forest, and neural network). Should I do machine learning and deep learning courses to organize my knowledge? I deeply understand that nobody can cover all the topics. It's just not happening. What I expect is to be well-prepared for job. Thank you\n",

      "4605 Man you're just reading my mind lately hahaha great video as always master master Ken\n",
      "4606 Yay thanks for having me :D A resource I wish I had before I picked my masters degree! And I need to say again - FANTASTIC EDITING!!\n",

      "4608 Hey Ken, great video. Im currently doing my BS in Data Science and plan on getting a full time job when I graduate, and have been looking at Georgia Techs Online Masters in Analytics to do part time. Do you know anything about this program / would you recommend doing the computer science one instead?\n",
      "4609 Again, nice job. It was really helpful. Now I understand how a model code should look like and I also learned some tricks. There is only one thing I think could have been better. Sometimes I couldn't understand what you were doing nor why. It felt like I was just watching you code. I understand it is hard to explain everything while you are debugging or improving the model, but you could have added some explanations while editing. Anyway, this doesn't take the value of the video. Many thanks!!\n",
      "4610 It was a journey. I am about to finish my project and I can't thank you enough. Hadn't I followed this playlist, my final project would be simply a bunch of code that no one would understand. Thanks again Ken.\n",

      "4615 The best thing about this video was watching Ken getting stuck, trying hard to figure out how to resolve the errors and googling the seaborn code. Just made me feel that it is totally okay to not know everything. Thank you Ken :)\n",
      "4616 Hello Ken !! Nice Video. I have a small doubt , is it good to have some Tableau Skills to add to Data Science resume ? I was planning on going through some MOOCs but thought about checking with you once , before I proceed ahead . Thanks in advance. \n",
      "4617 Hey Ken! What is the difference between a masters in Data Science vs a masters in Business Analytics?\n",
      "4618 If you want to get to the projects straight away go to 5:02 but you should listen to what hes got to say\n",
      "4619 Great video! Do you have any videos about your experience at Depaul? I'm enrolling next year.\n",
      "4620 I started keeping a journal (handwritten) of various functions and methods that I knew I would want to use again. The journal is long, but it made for quick reference when I encounter a problem that I know Ive solved before. I think the feeling of inadequacy comes from often seeing the finished work of very experienced people and never seeing the process. It almost makes it look like they can do it all in one go without referencing anything.\n",
      "4621 This is a good video. Tina's advice/input on course-based masters was definitely useful. I wish I knew about that going into my master's program. I'm doing research now that my professor plans to get published, but it took a lot of work to get to this spot. I don't know of any other master's student in my program doing research. Tina's right that generally, those opportunities are only available for undergrads and PhD students. I want to do an independent study in reinforcement learning to close out my last semester (next semester) but I already know that since I'm not a PhD student or curious undergrad, the chances of me getting that opportunity are slim to none. I'm hopeful that instead I might just continue to do research under the professor I'm currently working with. Course based masters definitely can be good, but it's also good to be aware of the possible cons that they can come with, and I think this video does a good job of explaining those pros and cons. I'll have to add this topic to the list of video ideas I got.\n",

I'm also working full-time and I will honestly not recommend anyone doing the program full-time while working full-time if you aren't already working in data science or have a strong base in the field. I'm in 4 classes this semester, and while I have a strong math background and comfortable programming in python, my programming skills are not the greatest and I am new to the Data Science field. I have found the time commitment to be a lot. Next semester I am definitely not taking more than 3 courses.\n",

      "4638 Hi Ken, while watching this video, I just realized that I'm now part of one data science community. Wow, thank you for bringing us all together! I'm looking forward to more of your videos about Kaggle projects. Lately, I found one very useful extension of jupyter notebook, TOC2, which automatically creates a table of contents with hyperlinks based on the headings. Its link: https://jupyter-contrib-nbextensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/nbextensions/toc2/README.html. Once you try it, I bet you will love it. However, it's not available in Kaggle yet. The closest thing it has is to display the first level headings on the right in the reading mode. There's large room for improvement. Louis posted in product feedback on Kaggle six months ago (https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/153519), but received little attention. What a pity! Can you help draw more attention and upvote it? If you have any other ideas, please let me know. I strongly believe that getting our sharing notebook well organized and more readable is very helpful for the community. TOC2 will make it much easier.\n",

      "4643 Hey I'm interested in data analysis/science too. Could you recommend any good books about data analysis in sports? I watched a movie \"Moneyball\" and it would be good to find out whether doing analysis in sports is useful. I'm a huge fan of basketball (NBA). So if you could give any suggestions, I would appreciate it a lot.\n",
      "4644 Thank you so much Ken. When someone loves the subject and teaches it to others, they will also start loving the subject. With your detailed unedited video, I gained a lot of confidence. I used to get overwhelmed with so many terms but seeing you I understood that not everyone knows everything. You just have to start with an idea and learn along the way by getting your hands dirty. Thank you once again. Have a great day!\n",

I beleive that was the best path for me to take since I want to start out as a Data Scientist and eventually scale over to Product Management. This program basically teaches me both skills. However, I've noticed that there are a lot of MS CS and MS DS majors who apply for these majors. Do you think I should change my major to match those or do you think I should remain in the track that I am. I still believe once I am done with the program, I'll have the same skillset as the other majors, I just don't want to get screened out of getting a chance to be interviewed.\n",

      "4664 Hi Ken, nice video! I didn't participate in this one but I'll join the discord server and do the next one! Quick question: what video editing software do you use? I see in your description your computer details and the camera you use, and I searched throughout your channel to make sure you didn't have a video talking about this stuff, so I'm sorry if you get asked this a lot, I just am going to be done with my second-to-last semester of grad school this week (!!!) and have like, 2 months for christmas break so I was going to spend some time learning editing stuff so I can hopefully start my own youtube channel soon enough. I can't afford the camera yet, but I don't need that to start. I've got some ideas and I just am curious to know what software you use to edit your videos. Do you have a preamp and a mic with a pop filter you use? Thanks!\n",

      "4700 Hey Ken, When I started the 66 days of data challenge my goal was to learn deep learning. I was going to learn it through some paid resources but little did I know that posting everyday would open doors to have recruiters talk with me. I got to speak with recruiters from Amazon, Facebook, and a consultancy group. I have now pivoted to Computer Vision as the niche I want to focus on. I look forward to doing this again in January.\n",
      "4701 The 66daysofdata challenge is actually helping me to get though with my degree thesis too. Seeing as I was doing the 5 min even if I was tired from work, I told myself: \"If I can do 5, I can do 10!\" and then set an extra goal of 5 min of daily thesis progress. Some days are harder than others, but it's working and I plan to finish it by February, and that's something a need to thank you for Ken! You really are an inspiration.\n",
      "4702 Ken please answer my query, I am a SE with 1 year of experience, I am learning ML/DS since around 6 months and recently I talked to the management of my company for transition to data science. They referred me to some research papers related to the respected domain which had seriously complicated math (look at it https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225708015_Impact_on_inventory_costs_with_consolidation_of_distribution_centers). I am really overwhelmed with all this and am kind of scared by looking at the same. What should I do?

      "4708 I joined the initiative and lasted maybe 10 days... This year has been really rough, but I've always had a problem finding the motivation to self-teach. My personal lesson that I learned was to take the \"5 mins a day\" to heart. My flawed plan at the beginning was to spend 2-3 hours everyday watching recordings of a bootcamp course I took to refresh my memory on coding, then dive into projects. I got burnt out super fast, and part of that was because I wanted to match the impressive strides I saw so many people making on Discord. I'll definitely pace myself better next time and not be stingy and actually buy an online course. And I'll definitely be looking forward to joining in at the beginning of next year for the next initiative, with all of these improvements in mind!\n",

      "4716 Hi Ken, I'm looking forward to the next 66days on linkedin. I had planned to join in the last one, but had trouble with twitter.\n",
      "4717 Oh man! What an excellent and beautiful video! I have learned so much these past few months, become so much better, it blows my mind. And it wasn't just Machine learning either. That being said, being part of the #66daysofdata community has certainly been a very large contributor to this, so many thanks for the opportunity ! :) And one thing that I found that helps for ... practically everything is something that I learned while watching a very old movie named the \"Silent Flute\". The script was originally written by none other than Bruce Lee who died before he could shoot it. It was taken over and the 'master' was played by none other than David Carradine. And despite showing its old age, it's full of wisdoms! One of them in particular struck a major cord inside me when David Carradine, playing the master who, according to his student, \"seemed to know everything\" he simply answered with this: \"Every time the sun rises, like the student on their first day of school, I open a blank page in my mind to write the lesson of the day.\" ... After which, I wrote this on a blank page and added \"... and have an actual, real blank page ready to write the lesson on it.\" I started this on the 14th of may and ... well ... still doing this every-single-day. It's incredible how much you can learn about ... everything when doing this little exercise and I certainly do like to mention Machine Learning here and there. Like, say, pointing out the importance of iterations in practically everything you can do and learn in life. Or use lessons I learned from something else, say art, and apply them to my Machine Learning studies -> The kind that says sometimes it's good to switch to something different. not only does it allows you to go back later with a fresh mind but, even better, for all you know, the other project you'll be working might give you ideas for the first one. Just watching this video is bringing back to memory some of the stuff that I have written in this 'book of wisdom' of mine and makes me want to say so many things about it that I won't do it. This post is already getting very long as it is, sorry for the wall of text. ( come to think of it, I need to write one on how to try to summarize my point of views much more briefly).

More seriously, right now, it's not so much ideas that I have problems with at the moment, it's finding enough data to run them ... yep, that time is closing faster than I thought where I will have to learn to scrape data for myself! Especially since many of the ideas I have are around using specific type of pictures (loads of them fantasy, science fiction .... also had an idea which will requires 'solar punk' pictures, all of that in the name of ART and by using ML :o) ). But, more likely, it will be about scrapping for text, especially released scripts from some of my favorite series ... or old books!! ( I wonder if I can do a 'whosdunnit' NLP thingy :o) ) ... so many choices, but doesn't choice imply renouncing some of said choices ? ;o)\n",

      "4759 You're really starting to get the hang of this YouTube(r) business down! The editing is looking great with the different camera angles and transitions and stuff. Have you considered streaming on Twitch or YouTube for some extra views/content? Resume reviews, portfolio reviews, interview advice/practice, teaching something, etc? I know you put out that course a while ago. Good content in the video by the way. I've been using Kaggle to learn some proper ML techniques and their implementations along with when/how to use them, and also get acquainted with Python more since I'm an such an R junkie. Playing with some stock data sets on there has been good for me, but I do agree, value or good business value comes from gathering some original data or doing something with some impact. I'm currently thinking about trying to build a special app/thingy (currently thinking an RShiny web app) that scrapes data/information on Yugioh's card collecting/valuation website and then so someone can enter what cards they have and how much (ignoring PSA value) and then it'll autopopulate the current valuation cell next to it or something. One small note, and I hope this doesn't come across as offensive, but I personally thought that the camera angle/cutaway/transition at around @6:45 was a bit awkward, as it looked like you were speaking but there was an audio lag or something. Very well could just be something due to my internet, but it took me out a little bit if you know what I mean. Nonetheless though, great video and great content. This channel has been immensely helpful and inspiring to me. Keep up the good work! Hopefully this large comment adds valuable data to your corpus you're building. Sorry for the special characters you'll have to get rid of when you tokenize and clean the data lol.\n",

      "4795 In my opinion, you should stick to the field you are interested in. And data should be complicated enough to be worth analyzing, not like two columns. But to get both the data and the idea is the biggest problem for me so far. I either have the idea, but it's nearly impossible to find any decent amount of data or there would be lots of data, but on a topic that I've never found the least exciting. Sometimes data isn't complicated enough for a project. For instance, I do monitor used cars sales on a regular basis, I just love reading about cars, comparing them. But the tricky thing is, there are like 5 or 6 variables to utilize, like mileage, color, horsepower, year produced etc. It's more than enough for eda, but there is not much room for machine learning project. The only interesting idea I came up with (apart fromobvious linear regression) is to analyze, whether mileage is real or not based on the price, number of owners etc. It seems like some fields are inferior in terms of generating data, than others\n",

      "4803 Another question, if we have the funds to pay for a Data Science degree at say Maryville University on line but it is not a masters do you feel that is okay? The other option is for my son to finish his current B.A. in PHHP at the University of Florida and move forward to the Post Baccalaureate degree to get the additional credits needed. He would then move on to the B.A. in C.S. and finish that degree. One is longer and a Public University the other is Private, but I belive he can obtain what he needs in Maryville. This is the trade off and frankly he hates the PHHP bachelor's and has 3 more semesters and I would like him to just move on. One is more time, One is more money. Please help with advice.\n",

      "4848 Hi Kenny, how about the DataQuest platform for Data scientists? Do you recommend investing money in it?\n",
      "4849 Hi Ken, I've been watching your channel for a bit. It's important you know that your videos are extremely helpful to not only me but everyone who watches them. Ken, we genuinely appreciate all the hard work you put into making them. Keep up the great work! Also, do you have a discord server? If not, I think a discord server would be a great way for all the members of your community to connect with one another and help each other on this long journey. I'm sure it'd help out your channel growth, and even connect you with very talented people. Either way, the videos are phenomenal. Thanks a ton, Adrian\n",
      "4850 Stop with the impostor syndrome Ken! ;) your content is good and you seem to be a very nice person, smart, down to earth and encouraging. No wonder your channel is growing! ;)\n",
      "4851 hey Ken, I noticed from your linkedin that you're based in honolulu. how do you like it there (pros? cons?) and how is the local data science job market?\n",
      "4852 Heyy, thankyou for your guidance. It's really helps a lot. Sorry it's a little lengthy, but it's important for us, so please read @Ken Jee Also, as you see, there's a significant number of your followers from India, so like it's really difficult for us to check which college is best in different countries like US, UK, Germany, which are already quite advanced in this field and will be really beneficial for us if we study there, so can you suggest and help us what to do or how to go about it. I really wanna study in Germany, but you know, money is always an issue for an international student, so a little bit of guidance in that too please.\n",
      "4853 That was a great video, Master Ken! Glad youve decided to go with DePaul which sets the first event in the domino effect that led you to posting your first video on YouTube \n",
      "4854 I struggle with things that take a long time. If I spend several years to become a master, what will I I actually have in the end? I will be able to predict some things. I guess the hardest thing for me to think about is that 5 years will be gone and will it be worth it. Maybe by then AI will do everything automatically. Like trying to program an operating system with assembly language or something.\n",
      "4855 Thanks so much Ken, it's very helpful to outline all the major parts of the project like you did.\n",
      "4856 Hey Ken, I really appreciate this series but I worry about the dependant variable being the 'Glassdoor Estimate' It seems overly possible that any trends that you find in this EDA are properties of the Glassdoor Salary Estimate algo. Anyhow, this is great as a proof of concept. I would love for you to make a 'Data Science from Scratch 2.0' where you tackle a problem in the sports domain, where you are an expert and there is a wealth of real-world data to choose from!\n",
      "4857 Hey. I am a graduate with Statistics as my subject. I am about to complete a diploma in Data Science. No technical background or job experience. I want to dive deeper into Data Science. What would you suggest me pick between getting a masters in Statistics, or drop and focus on more Data Science learning for one year. I am really confused with this decision :-(\n",
      "4858 Hi Ken, Thank you so much! I started learning data science 2 years back. but I lost the motivation. Now after following your channel, and watching the inspirational videos and great advice i feel confident to move forward, i am seeking career transition into data science, and you are motivating and helping me to stay on track.\n",

      "4866 You drove Uber on the weekends, and just studied ML all week long?\n",
      "4867 Personally I would not do a data science master degree.. there is no consistency between programs.. if one were to do a stats or CS degree as you go to different schools much of the curriculum is very similar.. electives might be different..\n",
      "4868 I started going through the Kaggle courses. The big picture makes sense, but I always forget syntax and stuff.\n",
      "4869 One of the best series I've ever seen on youtube related to data science. Thank you so much for this amazing effort. Very inspiring and motivating. Highly appreciated, bro.\n",
      "4870 Haha, very true about flipping the coin :) I was thinking about doing an extra degree in CS, but it takes a lot of time and after I checked the syllabus... many of the courses in the degree cover material I am not at all interested in and will not really be useful in the career I want.\n",
      "4871 I was wondering, why not UI Chicago or IIT Chicago ? Btw, great video as usual ! Short and simple, just the right amount of everything :)\n",
      "4872 Funny, A big reason I chose the school I'm in now was also because I didn't want to take the GRE lol.\n",
      "4873 I loved the fact that you went to DePaul and started this channel. I'm planning to apply for a masters in DS myself, I've learned a lot about sports analytics on this channel, and I'm hoping to start a channel myself one day :)\n",

      "4885 Both fun and informative video Thank you Ken\n",
      "4886 I think your commerce background IS important as it created one of the biggest filters in your decision making, that is, which school doesnt require a bachelors degree in Computer Science? I would think that the requirements in Data Science are lower, is that correct?\n",
      "4887 Do you feel like the masters degree was worth it or could you have gotten where you are now without one? If you come from a technical background, is the MS worth the investment?\n",
      "4888 Quality video as usual!\n",
      "4889 Did you know anyone who did their MS in DS at DePaul? I have a friend who is in that program and he said it's worth it but I was wondering if you knew anyone who did the program. I'm really considering doing a Master's in DS since I'm graduating with a BS in Finance from a B+ level school and I feel like I'll need an MS to get a good job in the field (I have bad ADHD and I'm not great at teaching myself things so I don't think the self-taught route is for me). Did you know anyone who did that program? How was their post grad job placement? Do you think the CS program was better?\n",
      "4890 Your editing skills have really improved since the start of your channel! This was a really well done video. I'd love to know more about how you do it since I'm considering starting a channel of my own. You have an interesting story and it's cool to see how far this channel has progressed. 100k is coming up! See you in the next vid! (okay so I was going to insert a peace emoji there at the end of my comment but the menu bar on my macbook's keyboard doesn't seem to want to work today....damn.)\n",

      "4894 Brilliant Video Ken!\n",
      "4895 It was most enlightening that a lot of the decision pruning was purely practical (ie: no BCS requirement; missed a deadline and didn't want to wait another year). Good reminder that we don't live in a perfect world; we live in this one. (... Also, on behalf of the entire community, please accept our humblest apologies for our dire transgressions, Master Master Kenneth Jee.)\n",

      "4909 How can anyone think the courses on Kaggle is good, I'll never know. I tried them, and was completely speechless. They are so bad, it's insane. And the Instructors are technicians who are so over the hill. I think that's why they're so bad. I need someone who's a beginner like me, not someone who's been working for 10 years.\n",
      "4910 Hi Ken, I'm newly transitioning into the data science field and am wondering how to approach building a data science resume if none of my work experience is in data science or tech.

      "4951 I think the reason why I would like to get into Data Science is just the outright versatility it can offer in many sectors such as finance,healthcare,IT etc. The whole concept of breaking down and finding solutions is interesting.

      "4953 Great info! I wonder if we are also allowed to use these resources during an interview?\n",
      "4954 Please also explain Git Bash to people who use Windows.\n",
      "4955 Hi, great video, some tips for the reader from what I learned from work: 1. I recommend to start including git in every project you do, I didnt do that, but I wish i did. It helps like ken said with version control, and easier changes publishing instead of going online and going through a whole process, and also ur gonna use it at work for sure so might as well practice. 2. Hes using GitBash, idk if it was mentioned and I missed it but thats the command line interface to use git. Its also good cause it uses Bash so if u know Linux/Ubuntu its be easier to use. I use the same but there are others if you dont want to start with a command line like VsCode, Atom, GitHub Desktop (although I recommend Bash). 3. use Git Status pretty much after every command because If ur in ur own branch, and want to switch to another one, all your work will be lost if not committed or stashed first. (Git Stash is just what it sounds like, temporarily stashed or saves your changes to the side so u can do other work and then Pop later).\n",

      "5075 \"We fail more then we success\" - so Data Science is like real Science... In Academia you only have high success to failure rate at low levels. Once you get to new and complex things it can get hard. Really hard. And depressing. Of course you can always be that lucky one and get your experiment parameters right in first go. ;) I used to be what a lot of people would think of as a \"real scientist\" (the one that does experiments in a lab coat, in a lab to discover and create new things). A lot of things in Academia is presented as if the success was effortless, nobody is showing the amount of work that went into it, results from failed experiments rarely get published if at all. One of my friends also has imposter syndrome (I have different issues ;) I am always hungry for knowledge and new things and I love solving problems; also I'm unemployed atm so I can't have an imposter syndrome)... As for failures - this is a normal part of the process. I don't remember who said it, but it went like this: when you enter the a new uncharted territory, when you try new things nobody did before, everybody is underqualified for the job. I think this is a huge part of what being a Scientist is - you try to do new things, and you fail, and you learn from it and you try again. Sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. Some problems can't get solved at this stage - maybe new tools, theories, new data need to appear first. Sometimes it is too expensive to do what is needed to get a good solution, maybe an approximation can be good enough? I'd like to say that this is why you get paid the big bucks - because it requires certain way of thinking, intelligence and skills to solve problems. To be a Scientist it ain't an easy job in general. Sadly a lot of Scientists are really poorly payed. And a lot of research is conducted in a very bad, unproductive way, but that's an off-topic. The job hunt - IMO it is a bit of lottery. And just because someone has amazing credentials doesn't necessarily mean they are amazing themselves. I've worked with people that had PhDs from an university ranked in world's top 25, one of these people came even from a VERY VERY good research group... and they were not living up to the standard I imagined. The best Scientists I worked with came from UK (university outside the country's top 10) and India. Of course good credentials do help you to get a job. That's why you should get them. But also get the understanding of the things you are doing and the knowledge of the subject. A PhD diploma is a proof a person wrote and defended a PhD, it does not make someone a good Scientist. Maybe it should, but these are two different things. I also heard words of wisdom that went like these: don't compare yourself to other people, you don't know their full story. Compare the you of yesterday to the you of today. I'm off with that - this comment is getting too long. Good video Ken :)\n",
      "5076 Thank you so much for this video! It resonated so much with me. I usually get these waves of insecurity aka imposter syndrome although it's always lurking in shadows. I have learned to just keep going and try to be honest about what I know and do not know. I have been told that I should be more confident though \n",

I doubt that if I will ever be able to learn all these concepts. :|\n",

      "5081 Thank you Ken, this type of videos - honest talk - really helps! Bests.\n",
      "5082 letterly this is what I feel almost in every competitive environment I engage in. Some times I have objective evidence that I am worse than most people like in sport when no one picks me to play in their team. And sometimes in the contrary I think I'm bad but when I see other people's performance I know that I'm not. I think that is because we fail to something called survivorship bias. Most of the people that we see are successful since successful people have more popularity so the sample of people that we are comparing ourselves with is not random.\n",
      "5083 Me: \"Wow I am seriously unqualified for this position...... better apply!\" Okay but in all seriousness, thank you for your honesty on this one. I think you spoke to what a lot of us are feeling & it's great to know none of us are ever alone on this :) also.......can we or can we not get a #66DaysofData Among Us game night one of these days?!\n",
      "5084 As a beginner, I've had this feeling for the past 6 months, when I look at job offers there is always one or two or plenty of things that I'm not familliar with at all .. but you have made it easier for me to improve myself each day through your videos and tutorials, and hopefully I will land an internship in the next 2 months.\n",
      "5085 After 2-3 years experience, I have a strategy for dealing with imposter syndrome. Keep a reading/to-learn list, with techniques, frameworks or anything data science related. As soon as you feel a spell of imposter syndrome coming, learn something asap and don't stop learning until you feel better again\n",
      "5086 One thing I neglected to mention is that part of impostor syndrome is that you feel like you're going to get \"found out\".

      "5088 Great video and topic Ken! I think everyone feels this to an extent. Super important to be humble and modest, although confidence is key too!\n",
      "5089 I really liked how he talked about learning to like this feeling. I think a physical training metaphor here is really apt. When you work out it hurts and is uncomfortable as you train muscles you may not be using very often. One thing many people who work out regularly talk about is how good they feel afterwards, even though their body is in pain. Similarly whenever you learn something it hurts, almost phyically. You can feel your mind straining to try and understand whatever abstract concept your reading about. For some reason we are surpised by this. \"Shouldn't this be easier?\", \"How does anyone understand this\", or \"The guy in the video I watch made it seem like this was easy to understand\". of course we do not see how long they had to sturggle to actually understand the concept. If we go in with the expectiation, this going to hurt but I love that feeling of brain ache after a good reading I think it can help with those feelings a lot. The other issue is time, the feeling that you need to become competent in a short ammount of time sucks. I don't know what to do about that, we are finite creatures after all.\n",
      "5090 I feel like in the technology field Impostor Syndrome has just become a consistent feeling a lot of people develop..I remember doing my Bachelor's for CS and constantly feeling inadequate or inferior by comparison to my peers cause I felt like my coding abilities in comparison to theirs were terrible..That got heightened when it came to applying for jobs and getting rejections all throughout college...Ironically the one thing that kind of got me out of my own head when it came to that feeling was Data Science..I found a genuine passion for wanting to do it and that kind of helped me subvert the Imposter Syndrome I felt from coding at least...Now I'm in my first semester of going after my Data Science Masters and I still feel that Impostor Syndrome looking at how qualified my peers are by comparison and questioning my own abilities yet again but also having gone through it the first time around I realize a lot of that is just me being in my own head....similar to how you've embraced it over the years...Thanks for posting about this Ken...You, DataLeap and the Data Professor have become my go to channels to watch ever since I started my Data Science journey 2 months ago and hearing that you feel that level of doubt in your own life even with how much of a great figure you are in the Data Science community is honestly kind of relieving to know......\n",

      "5107 Hi ken, loved the content you have been putting out regarding DS, I have some doubts regarding my situation since its quite specific and I wanted to get your opinion. I was going to start my undergrad as an Engineer in Data and Mathematics but I have decided to wait one more year so that I can study in Germany (I live in Mexico so returning here with with a German title will allow me to secure a job with ease). In the mean time I have been considering possibly switching majors to something like Economics, or Physics. I have thought of becoming a DS for two years now, however I am worried that the Job opportunities DS promises might shrink and that my degree might limit me the amount of jobs I can find in comparison to the other degrees I am interested in. I am not the best at coding however I have been told that as long as I know how to properly query with SQL (which I can) and have a good exposition of my data, I should be fine. Although I know I would enjoy my time studying something like Economics I feel like it would be really easy for me and I would only want to get in degree in something I struggle with so that I have a more complete profile when I enter the corporate world. TLDR: I really enjoy the implications of being a DS and want a challenging major, but I don't know if Im cut out to be one and might consider just doing a Masters after an undegrad in something else.\n",

I did not realized it has been so long until today. Just keep it as a habit. I've worked in the manufacturing industry for over 10 years. I strongly believe that AI and big data analysis will bring our industry to a brighter future. Though I'm still struggling in picking up the data science skills, I hope to bring awareness of AI power to more people from the manufacturing industry. That's why I started my sharing of AI, big data analysis, the driven power behind IT industry, 5G, block chain. The highest number of views are 100~200, still far away from those popular posts which got thousands of views. I'm not discouraged because I know what I'm doing and why I'm doing it. So I will keep making my efforts.\n",

      "5138 I was thinking of taking data science because it involved coding. But now I'm not so sure about it.\n",
      "5139 Hey Ken! Thanks for another great video. I have a question about projects on resumes. I am struggling to think of ways to quantify the purpose of projects beyond just the results of different machine learning models. Because the results are not really put to use after finding them, there is no real quantitative impact to put on the resume (such as a 10% increase in sales). Is it necessary or suggested to have this for your projects? If so, what ways might you go about restructuring/expanding upon data science projects to address their possible \"lack of usability\" ?\n",

      "5143 Would you recommend doing a university course in this type of area or doing something like a physics degree and then trying to get into sports analytics\n",
      "5144 Hey Ken! Another video idea for the pile: a video on the maths you need to do data science and the best places to learn it. I've been slowing working my way through the Mathematics for Machine Learning textbook and it's hard work for someone who never did maths outside of high school.\n",

Can I use a bit or do I have to do everything from scratch?\n",

      "5151 Hey Ken, Im really enjoying this series, I just have a quick question. If I was crunched on space in fitting all the projects Ive done, would you say its better to keep your most recent projects on your resume OR would you rather advise to keep the projects that are relevant to the position/company you are applying to although its been 2-3 years since youve worked on that specific project?\n",
      "5152 Thanks for another great resume review! It gave me a lot of ideas of how I can improve my own resume.\n",
      "5153 hey ken , should we describe the personal projects we did in the resume or just mentioning them with an understandable name is enough? thanks\n",
      "5154 great helpful video can I also send you my resume for review on the next video ?\n",
      "5155 Ken, I'm a huge fan of your channel! I think you're providing an incredible service to aspiring data scientists. The insight you provide is so valuable, even in careers beyond data science. I'm doing my PhD in Chemistry but I've really taken an interest in data science over the past few months. Right now I've been applying machine learning to help develop low-cost COVID diagnostic platforms in our laboratory. I still have a lot to learn but who knows, maybe one day you'll be reviewing my resume!\n",
      "5156 Now every algorithms works in order to show what we want to watch say YouTube, Google Ads etc.. So sir my question is doesn't it makes us less interested in exploring new things. What if algorithms only shows content based on our past results and never lets us know new things. Suppose i don't have any idea what is deep learning and even didn't hear it before. So how it is likely that one will get to know about it, just by recommendation system or any other search result. Sorry it might sounds weird \n",

      "5170 Thank you Ken for creating this video. Simple rules and defining what these rules are a great way to start. I am also starting my data science journey and found this motivating and helpful.\n",
      "5171 Hi Ken. First off, thanks for all the quality content you put out. I have a question after watching this and your boot camp vs certificate video. I've got a physics work background with no degree. I'm looking to go back to school for a masters in physics in mind, but interested in combined/joint degree options. I'm leaning towards mathematics, but with the priority of CS towards Data Science, I might consider the later. Would a bootcamp be enough as long as I do my own projects and networking to keep DS an option, or would you strongly recommend the Phys/CS joint degree over the combined phys/math -> masters -> bootcamp option. I already have some programming history with a technology diploma and wouldn't mind the bootcamp. Thanks\n",
      "5172 Is there an API for NCAA basketball stats???\n",
      "5173 Is the get_teams() function pre-written??? I'm confused as to where that comes from. Also, love your vids!\n",
      "5174 Agreed, there is no replacement for real world projects. When tutorials are designed, they will always come to a successful model with good results and will usually have the data nicely prepared for you. That's exactly opposite of the real world. You may work on a project for weeks and conclude there is no signal in the data at least in its current form, or you may work weeks on just preparing data or learning enough domain knowledge to understand the data. That said tutorials and class learning are great to learn the workflow and structure of analysis. As you said you will be constantly going back and forth between direct coding and learning new methods to tackle new problems. I would say if you have an idea of the domain you will be working in, you should focus your efforts on the models and concepts relevant to that domain. There isn't a whole lot of similarity between analyzing mass scientific tabular data and computer vision.\n",
      "5175 Wonderful presentation. Thanks very much for all the info!\n",
      "5176 Hey, Ken I also want to learn data science but i am confuse form where i start to learn data science. Can you provide me Step that i can follow to be a data scientist\n",

      "5180 Hi Ken I need help here. When to choose a source, the master branche didn't appear on my choices, only the main appeared. And so my website's link gave 404 error. Is there anywhere I cld have mistaken when the process? I need help here\n",

      "5198 Great video! You should have mentioned RShiny/Shiny apps in your second (third?) bullet point though! But I'm heavily partial/biased towards R haha. Great vid. I like the idea of doing a project involving web scraping. The one thing that can be frustrating about being in grad school for stats is all of our data sets are already cleaned for us. We just get it and most of the time it's all good to go so we can just worry about doing whatever statistics we need to do on it. Scraping data sounds like a good way to get some nice raw data that would require some cleaning and then running some cool analytics on after some EDA. Great content.\n",

      "5220 Hey Ken, your down-to-basics and straightforward approach to the explaining data science and learning it are very confidence-inspiring to someone trying to get into the field. I have a background somewhat in statistics in that I graduated with an undergrad in psychology but with a focus on statistics. I did 3 quantitative and 1 qualitative study in undergrad and I think I have some chance of using that to my advantage. I'm working currently to pay the bills and keep needs like health insurance available and I'm currently starting the self-study method. I've binged through a few videos and I'm going to try \"ultralearning\" data science, but I'm really not sure where to go from there. I'm going to try to build a good portfolio but I feel like if I just try to say\" I have a degree in psych buut it's with a focus on psych stats\" and then get just a cert or a bootcamp then it won't be worth it for anybody looking to hire. Getting a masters is always on the table but like you said that's a big time and money commitment for no guarantee of a career out of the gate. In the end I think the connections of a bootcamp are more beneficial for me but I also don't want to shell out cash to find out that method would not make me look as good on a resume compared to a degree program. Do you think a psych degree is a handicap or something I can still leverage?\n",

      "5224 A couple of years down the line I want to build ML algorithms that do simple yet effective stuff. My weak area is statistics and this is something I really need to improve on. Understanding the equations of the graph to begin with maybe? Although I know a lot of statistical packages do most of the stuff for you but I believe understanding the underlying algorithm or the derivation of the equations would be helpful further down the line as I progress. With plethora of resources, I simply don't know where to get started and where to stop.

      "5229 You know what I hate about modern day sports analytics? You got all these terms that never existed like 10 or so years ago in sports with strange names that are hard to figure out what they even mean. Yet people continuously write articles referencing them as if the average sports fan already knows what all these are and they're self explanatory even though they clearly aren't and it's fancy jargon that you have no clue what it could possibly mean. Like I was reading an article talking about Breonna Stewarts win shares in her WNBA career. Nowhere in the article did it explain what win shares mean. Obviously it has to do with wins. But beyond that I have no clue. Then there is this other one that has defense or defensive in the title I can remember the full name of the stat but it's a really strange name. It's mentioned all the time as if it's common sense to what it means and we should already know. Lol. Nobody ever explains these things as if they're normal stats. Lol.\n",

      "5234 Hey Ken, I am in the process of changing my major from a B.S. in Speech-Language Pathology (SLP) to Data Science as the ROI (Return on Investment) is sub par in SLP and I have discovered many interesting facets associated with Data Science. I have to take some prereqs before I can apply to my university's B.S. in Data Science program. However, I became concerned as you mentioned that Data Science COULD become oversaturated even if I have a Master's degree (SLP is too since they'll take anyone ranging from pre-med to Underwater Basket Weaving). Will I keep a high-paying job if I make this transition now and have a few years of experience after earning a grad degree, or should I do the following: 1) B.S. in Data Science with Actuarial Science Minor 2) B.A. or B.S. in Stats with a Minor in Computer Science 3) Pick something in tech, business, econ/finance, or another field. After learning from the recent pandemic and reevaluating my college career, I have surmised that I want to do a tech, math, computer, business, or finance/econ-based job from home. I was misled (many of my classmates as well) by those in SLP and believed I could do work from home, but just like many majors they use work-from-home as a marketing strategy and omit info that there are many strings attached to this premise.\n",

      "5241 Hi. Thanks for this very informative video. Got a question. Would appreciate if you can help me out. I'm doing petroleum engineering currently. Junior year. I'm starting to get interested in data analysis and data visualization to be more specific. What would you recommend? I haven't learnt any programming languages yet but I'm decent with excel.\n",
      "5242 \"Who calls it BIG DATA anymore\" - BEST\n",
      "5243 Hi Ken, I'm currently into data engineering with 4 years of experience in big data analytics, wanna move to data science, which one will be good for me !! Here I have 2 courses in my mind , based on content can you suggest which one is better https://www.appliedaicourse.com/course/11/Applied-Machine-learning-course https://www.edvancer.in/course/data-science-specialization/ Thanks in advance\n",
      "5244 There is a degree on the college that i applied to that has data science as an undergraduate degree, its pretty cool but it goes more through the math and statistics path\n",
      "5245 Hi Ken, tell me what you think of my idea. Given my age and current educational background and the fact that we are in a pandemic and many companies are probably mitigating risks in regards to hiring, trying to find myself an entry-level data analyst job will probably be next to impossible. I have decided that I am going to be starting a master's program this fall. I am deciding on Colorado State University Global's AI and Machine Learning master's degree or going with Eastern University's Master's in Data Science. Eastern's program is brand new, so it probably does not have many reviews yet. It seem like it is a program for all ability levels, so I'm not sure of the robustness of the program. I am thinking of going for a double master's in this field. I could go the PhD route if I'm going to have a master's already by the end of next year, but I do not feel like setting myself back several tens of thousands of dollars more in debt for doctorate school. I figure the job market is not going to get any where near normal until at least 2023. With so many people out of work and looking for new jobs, I feel it is going to get super competitive. With the rock bottom tuition for some of these programs helping to minimize student loan debt, I might as well use this time to rack up a master's degree or two in this field.\n",
      "5246 Nice video Ken, thanks for explaining it so well, easy to get frustrated with learning! So I don't need to be a data scientist to get a job in data science, In the process of learing python, data analysis looks to be a good area to get work in where i live, am i on the right track?\n",
      "5247 Now, I am learning about data science field to begin my new career path. This video helps me a lot to guide my way into this field.

      "5330 Ive worked in Data Science for three years now. When you go to that interview my best advice is to be studied up and give good examples of practical experience. It is quite rewarding I went from 58k starting now at 72K three years I pay 0 dollars and 0 cents for health care that is a Cadillac Plan I get 10 sick days a year and 3 weeks Vacation Time. I do not pay for food when I am at work they cater in meals. Heres some personal advice to prepare yourself. Kick all bullshit people and situations out of your life. This includes All Social Media you need to focus and be prepared. You need to really be strong in systems and troubleshooting skills of those systems. DO NOT TAKE YOUR PHONE IN THE INTERVIEW. TAKE A NOTEPAD AND HAVE YOUR OWN PEN SUGGEST A FISHER SPACE PEN IT WILL WRITE AND NOT MAKE YOU BE IN A PEN BEGGING SITUATION>. My interview was five people that you need to convince you are worth a shit. I do remember a remarkable moment in the interview where I was asked about Social Media I stated that I had closed all my Social Media Years prior. These systems are complex and use many inter relationship application features to communicate data to one another. You need to be able to show this understanding. You need to be able to find and isolate issues in that system. You need to be able to answer questions about particular data points and features. This is not for everybody. I'm just going to lay it all out here if you fuck off at work and arent truly focused dont apply. If you are the type of person who just wants a check who thinks showing up is good enough dont apply. This is why they have so many people at the interviews for these jobs. They are trying to see if you have what it takes and are disciplined. I used number four applied with in the company. Yes they paid for the training after selection. By the way the criteria was stiff 90% weighted grades required or you would be let go. There was 19 people in the class 15 made it. When I was hired 5 people were hired at the same time 4 of those have been fired. Theres good money to be made here if you show you are serious they will keep raising your pay. Reasons for firing one was on FaceBook all the time. One was a Narcissitic Drama Queen. One had tons of excuses for not completing Tasks. One got fired for Sexual Harrassment. These people have good money to pay and they know it. PACK YER POOP TIGHT thats Marine speak for SHIT together.\n",

I was a very happy Data Analyst when COVID Crisis hit (the industry was aviation so yeah...). I also have some experience with six sigma, lean manufacturing and production as well. What would you advise a person like me? I was thinking about getting a bunch of certificates - those offered by deeplearning.ai on Coursera seem to be ok (as opposed to IBM Data Science course - this one sucks), also Coursera has several courses organized by Google, AWS, Mongo DB, etc that seem interesting, as they prove presence of some practical skills in real industry used tools. What do you think is the better option - bootcamp or a collection of certificates? I leaning towards collection of certificates - this means I don't have to go through the basics of Python programming again, and in the price of the bootcamp (say 2500 usd) I can get some interesting collection of new skill certificates or deepen those I feel need deepening.\n",
      "5346 How Much Math do I need in Data Science? Math skills are essential in data science and machine learning I. Introduction If you are a data science aspirant, you no doubt have the following questions in mind: Can I become a data scientist with little or no math background? What essential math skills are important in data science? There are so many good packages that can be used for building predictive models or for producing data visualizations. Some of the most common packages for descriptive and predictive analytics include: Ggplot2 Matplotlib Seaborn Scikit-learn Caret TensorFlow PyTorch Keras Thanks to these packages, anyone can build a model or produce a data visualization. However, very solid background knowledge in mathematics is essential for fine-tuning your models to produce reliable models with optimal performance. It is one thing to build a model, it is another thing to interpret the model and draw out meaningful conclusions that can be used for data-driven decision making. Its important that before using these packages, you have an understanding of the mathematical basis of each, that way you are not using these packages simply as black-box tools. II. Case Study: Building A Multiple Regression Model Lets suppose we are going to be building a multi-regression model. Before doing that, we need to ask ourselves the following questions: How big is my dataset? What are my feature variables and target variable? What predictor features correlate the most with the target variable? What features are important? Should I scale my features? How should my dataset be partitioned into training and testing sets? What is principal component analysis (PCA)? Should I use PCA for removing redundant features? How do I evaluate my model? Should I used R2 score, MSE, or MAE? How can I improve the predictive power of the model? Should I use regularized regression models? What are the regression coefficients? What is the intercept? Should I use non-parametric regression models such as KNeighbors regression or support vector regression? What are the hyperparameters in my model, and how can they be fine-tuned to obtain the model with optimal performance? Without a sound math background, you wouldnt be able to address the questions raised above. The bottom line is that in data science and machine learning, mathematical skills are as important as programming skills. As a data science aspirant, it is therefore essential that you invest time to study the theoretical and mathematical foundations of data science and machine learning. Your ability to build reliable and efficient models that can be applied to real-world problems depends on how good your mathematical skills are. To see how math skills are applied in building a machine learning regression model, please see this article: Machine Learning Process Tutorial. Lets now discuss some of the essential math skills needed in data science and machine learning. III. Essential Math Skills for Data Science and Machine Learning 1. Statistics and Probability Statistics and Probability is used for visualization of features, data preprocessing, feature transformation, data imputation, dimensionality reduction, feature engineering, model evaluation, etc. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Mean, Median, Mode, Standard deviation/variance, Correlation coefficient and the covariance matrix, Probability distributions (Binomial, Poisson, Normal), p-value, Bayes Theorem (Precision, Recall, Positive Predictive Value, Negative Predictive Value, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve), Central Limit Theorem, R_2 score, Mean Square Error (MSE), A/B Testing, Monte Carlo Simulation 2. Multivariable Calculus Most machine learning models are built with a dataset having several features or predictors. Hence, familiarity with multivariable calculus is extremely important for building a machine learning model. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Functions of several variables; Derivatives and gradients; Step function, Sigmoid function, Logit function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) function; Cost function; Plotting of functions; Minimum and Maximum values of a function 3. Linear Algebra Linear algebra is the most important math skill in machine learning. A data set is represented as a matrix. Linear algebra is used in data preprocessing, data transformation, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Vectors; Norm of a vector; Matrices; Transpose of a matrix; The inverse of a matrix; The determinant of a matrix; Trace of a Matrix; Dot product; Eigenvalues; Eigenvectors 4. Optimization Methods Most machine learning algorithms perform predictive modeling by minimizing an objective function, thereby learning the weights that must be applied to the testing data in order to obtain the predicted labels. Here are the topics you need to be familiar with: Cost function/Objective function; Likelihood function; Error function; Gradient Descent Algorithm and its variants (e.g. Stochastic Gradient Descent Algorithm) IV. Summary and Conclusion In summary, weve discussed the essential math and theoretical skills that are needed in data science and machine learning. There are several free online courses that will teach you the necessary math skills that you need in data science and machine learning. As a data science aspirant, its important to keep in mind that the theoretical foundations of data science are very crucial for building efficient and reliable models. You should, therefore, invest enough time to study the mathematical theory behind each machine learning algorithm.\n",

      "5419 As a basketball fan and a data science enthusiast I loved this video. I would be very interested to see how something like that (moving the 3 point line back) would effect the way defensive schemes are designed and how it would change the game as a whole. I have also talked to people in the past about the idea of simply removing those corner threes and having the arc be 23.75 feet all the way to the sidelines. I think cutting out that corner 3 would have a huge effect on both offensive and defensive schemes.\n",

Obviously it depends on the model and the use case but I'm having a hard time figuring out what cloud service to use. I was doing a bunch of research on turning one of my models into a productionized web app and I was trying to decide between AWS and Heroku. Heroku is definitely way easier and way more hands off but would it look better from a hiring managers perspective if I took the time to learn some devops and fired up an AWS instance with my model running on it? Or does it not really matter and Heroku is fine to use as it is convenient Thanks if you see this and all the amazing work you do! :D\n",

      "5551 Hi Ken, Many thanks for your interesting and insightful sharing! I 'm from China, and have been following you on youtube. I worked for 3 Fortune-500 companies (European, American) in different roles (research, application, marketing) in the manufacturing industry in the past ten years. I like learning and taking challenges. My current challege is to redirect my career development into data science field to keep up with intelligent era. I hope to master the big-data-analysis skill and apply it to the digital transformation of manufacturing industry. I started learning machine learning and data analysis respectively 2~3 years ago, and took several on-line courses on Udacity, Coursera, DataCamp. I'm major in material science and engineering, much different from CS , mathematcs or statistics. There's so much to pick up! Everytime I feel like learning more, I soon found out much more to learn. It's quite overwhelming... Your sharing helped me know better about the world of data science. As you advised, I'm now working on the Kaggle competition. Even though, the course I took before had several projects based on the Kaggle datasets and competition, it's my first time to participate in on my own. Besides, this week, I started uploading my work to github and Kaggle to build up my profile.\n",
      "5552 I love this. I read Atomic Habits earlier this year and it inspired me to add more structure to my life. If I'm being honest, some of my habits have stuck better than others. Do you struggle with this and how do you tackle it? Thanks!\n",
      "5553 Great video. I'm a mech engineer and have a couple of months in Codecademy data science and computer science. I have used Python before in a college projects of statistics and vehicles but now I really want to be able to feel condident saying I use it. Learning by doing projects and uppering the level is the best option, keep on with the good advice!\n",
      "5554 i just cant solve kaggle problems should i quit this field its been 10months already\n",
      "5555 I really like the Notebook Viewer idea. makes it very simple to follow through with code. I've just tried it out for the first time at: https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/ seems simple enough, just copy and paste url of the notebook you want to be used.\n",
      "5556 Haha, the part at the beginning really got me! :D There is some truth to this, it is just like overfitting a model but in a different way. Interesting interview for sure :D #KenJeePodcast\n",
      "5557 Thanks for great videos ken that helps alot\n",
      "5558 U r the best...simply awesome videos\n",
      "5559 Aren't you data snooping the test set by doing a train-test split after EDA? Also, great series. Very helpful.\n",
      "5560 Nice, I started to learn machine learning a week ago, soon will join u after finishing basic courses!\n",
      "5561 Hi Ken, Do you play fantasy football of premier league?\n",
      "5562 Really helpful insights Ken\n",
      "5563 Great Video Mr. Jee. I have one question, he talks a lot about A/B testing. Can you describe what that means for a beginner data scientist like myself?\n",
      "5564 hi Ken, really helpful video! Do you have any examples of how to include Github and Git into my routine? (you mentioned it at the end of the video). Do i just focus on getting my project on github or focus on how to store it and present it (if thats the case, is there a tutorial on it or would you be interested in doing some tutorials?). Or is it something totally different. Keep up the good work!\n",
      "5565 Thank you so much\n",
      "5566 Hey man, Really glad to find individuals such yourself. I will be joining a bit late but starting today. For sure each person should apply himself the best method suited to their own motivation and capabilities. Myself I started with Data Camp, its user interface and the app helps me a lot to engage on it and will be using the hashtag you displayed. Keep it up please, you are honest and very approachable in your videos, your first person perspective is one of the sparks I needed. Thank you very much man. You really rock. Regards from Barcelona.\n",
      "5567 good stuff. One question: what about restoration/renewal? We aren't machines. We need to cycle though and schedule rest also.\n",
      "5568 Hi Ken. Just found your channel recently and its been an amazing resource for me. Im new to data science and as a former athlete, Im hoping to work in sports analytics eventually. However I have a background working in product creation in the apparel industry for 10 years. Based on what youve said a few times, it seems my best path is working in data science in apparel before transitioning into sports? If I wanted to start building my portfolio, would it be weird to have projects in both categories? Should I only show apparel projects now and do sports for fun? A little confused on how I should present myself.\n",
      "5569 Thanks for having Jeremie on, Ken!\n",
      "5570 I actually wanted to ask an question that i am currently doing stats as my classwork and i am pretty much enjoying with along with some algebra. But i wanted to know that is calculus and others math are cruciel? I am not good at it\n",
      "5571 Hey ken...what is your opinion about moving from data analyst role to more of manager role...also how many years of work experience should one have before the transformation(Is 2-3 years sufficient)?\n",
      "5572 can you send the pdfs?\n",
      "5573 i'm already equipped with basic python knowledge, how do i begin Data Science\n",
      "5574 When sharpestminds.com will be launching in india?\n",
      "5575 Great piece!!\n",
      "5576 Hopefully they come to Argentina\n",
      "5577 Amazing interview! My only feedback would be add timestamps to the video/description outlining of each of the topics discussed. Would be helpful if I wanted to come back and re-listen to a part of the interview.\n",
      "5578 Really enjoyed this awesome discussion between Jeremie and you Ken! Learned a lot, especially liked the perspectives from the physics and entrepreneurship point of views on approaching data science. \n",
      "5579 Hey Ken! Thanks for the video, what about Computer Information Systems? Thank you\n",
      "5580 Hey Ken! I have question regarding a portfolio website. Is it bad if \"stole\" my portfolio website github page from someone else. I found this https://orysyastus.github.io/ github pages website and I really like the way this person has everything laid out and I was just gonna fork it and put my own information and my own projects on it. But does that look bad to a future employer? Like I was too lazy to create my own portfolio from scratch? And the other thing I worry about it is what if like 5,000 other people all had the same idea as me and then my portfolio page looks identical to other people that all forked from this same github page lol. Curious to hear your insight on these concerns/thoughts I've had when it comes to making a portfolio website\n",
      "5581 I'm a product manager that is looking to build up data analytics skills. Do I really need to go deep into programming to build a data science background?\n",
      "5582 Wow, I also studied physics at university:) Great guest and cool interview\n",
      "5583 I wish life saw stepwise regression .......\n",
      "5584 Hello Data professor and Ken jee. I would like to say thank for your efforts.I have one question why he put link \"https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfoloio_2/\" instead of local http:// localhost:1313. we have to make local host to dynamic site. He put already exist website link in atom text editor.What about he crated local site , he did not use it.Can you explain or give solution why he used it.\n",

      "5586 Interesting analogy relating gradient descent and entrepreneurship by Jeremie! Not the first one saying this but it would be great if Sharpest Minds opened up in India and other developing countries.\n",
      "5587 Data Science Jay and I were just talking about this unique space, awesome to hear from Jeremie and Ken (as always)\n",
      "5588 I applied in hopes that I could get mentorship when it comes to looking for an entry-level data analyst job. All I got was it said I am a bit too early and should brush up on my fundamentals. My goal is to someday be a data scientist, but I realize that is going to take me several months if not years to obtain such role, and have since been solely focusing on acquiring enough skills to land an entry-level data analyst job. I was unable to get assistance from the VA to pursue a master's in data science degree, so now I am left to my own defenses in learning these skills on my own. I have been using Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn) for nearly a year now. I have completed a handful of data analyst projects and posted them on GitHub. I have over a year with using SQL. I am now taking a Coursera course on Tableau and working on an Oracle Database Administrator certification course. How much longer will it take for me to land an entry-level data analyst job? I am doing what I can to not have to take out more student debt for a CS degree.\n",
      "5589 Hello Jeremie Harris, Sorry but SharpestMinds is not operating in India. We have a lot of MOOC's available and it becomes confusing in which one to take. To be practical or theory. Especially I get confused like when I take up theory I tend to take theory as I do not understand the things used and why and when doing theory I tend that I am lacking the practical. I end up really end doing absolute nothing. I really am looking for such a thing and would really help not only for me but all of the aspirants in India. Please may it available for enthusiast like us .Please can you make it available in India. Thanks Piyush Talele\n",
      "5590 SharpestMinds, the team and company, are both truly amazing and really the best mentorship programs in this space. Only request to them would be to expand to India soon \n",
      "5591 I remember hearing about this on Kirils podcast SDS\n",
      "5592 first view! first like and the very first comment\n",
      "5593 A great video with so much knowledge and handy pick up things to improve for oneself. That portfolio looks smooth, any possibility you might do another video on portfolio building (feat data professor)? Would love it!\n",
      "5594 I'm currently a CS student. Would that help me land a data scientist job even without acquiring a masters degree in data science?\n",
      "5595 Hi Ken, i am currently doing masters in statistics, and thinking about doing an M.Sc in data Scienc. After graduating my main focus is landing a job in statistics related field. Which one do you think is better? M.Sc in Statistics or M.sc in Data Science from the perspective of landing a job?\n",
      "5596 Guys how to make \"skills enclosed in the box\" eg. Python, Keras? Check 3:49. Those look so awesome!. How to make them in LibreOffice? Help! Thanks, Ken Jee for the sharing another awesome video! His clean and neat CV is something I want to make on my own. Is there any paid/non-paid platform where I can make the CV in similar template?\n",
      "5597 Can we please talk about how he actually replied to everyone?!\n",
      "5598 Hey Ken Can I use this model for my work. Im thinking of creating something similar for soccer\n",
      "5599 Thank you so much, Ken! You are truly amazing!!!\n",
      "5600 Hey Ken I've got a question for you related to projects and stuff you look for on a entry level data scientists resume/portfolio. I'm trying to decide what I should do for my next project and I'm unsure what will look better on my resume. Project A - Kaggle: - finish top 10% in a Kaggle competition and write a blog post outlining each step of the process and explaining my thought process of why I chose certain algorithms and my understanding of certain concepts Project B - solve a cool problem or answer a question with data science: -Pull data from an API database to get experience with SQL or collect my own data source through scraping -Clean the data -Do some advanced feature engineering with the data -Do some testing on different models to figure out which one performs the best -Create a website and put the end model into production -write a blog post about the project and its results Would love to hear your thoughts on this and if you value placing well on Kaggle more than a personal project that solves an interesting question. Cheers!\n",
      "5601 With recruiting season underway this series has been very helpful to me Ken!\n",
      "5602 This was such a brilliant walkthrough. I thought the basic github pages video before was good enough, but this produces quite a professionally finished product, in 45mins and FREE! So happy that you made this. 1 question: once youve done an initial commit and the website is up, how do you then do a small update? Do you edit it locally again and upload the whole public folder again to the GitHub repo? Or is there some more efficient way?\n",
      "5603 Review someone's resume or portfolio who applied for internship that would be great help\n",
      "5604 Great analysis as always Ken! I have a query, I have been working as a Data scientist for past 4 years in IT services firm and have delivered projects in Engineering domain(customers in manufacturing , aero, auto etc) . Even though I have some good projects(the ones I delivered for the customers) to showcase on CV, I don't have a proper GitHub profile because I cant recreate the projects I did in GitHub because of customer /project confidentiality. In this case what would be your advice on building a solid GitHub profile, which datasets / project I can work on?\n",
      "5605 Hey, Ken! Would it be alright if I just put links to my Kaggle notebooks in my GitHub portfolio or are there some important benefits from basically copying into GitHub repos?\n",
      "5606 Great video! :)\n",
      "5607 Cool, lately one great portfolio follows the next one, haha :D Great to see all of these clean portfolios!\n",
      "5608 Any recommended text books?\n",
      "5609 hello man, could you address the gap issue if someone has couple of years gap since he/she graduated. is this gonna be a problem in industry to get a job after 3...4 years even he/she gets certificates from 365 data science or somewhere else. this person's core computer science concepts are still fresh. please give me a broad view of this issue or post a video if that's possible. thank you :)\n",
      "5610 Hey Ken, so I have a project where I train a neural network to determine if a piece of text is toxic or not. However, during the exploration portion of the data, racial and homophobic slurs are shown (graphs and word cloud) to emphasize that they are the most common toxic words. How would I go about saying that I do not condone these words?\n",
      "5611 Loving this series! Awesome job Pranay \n",
      "5612 Hey ken can you do another series of building a data science project form scratch?? That series was a great learning experience for me.. thanks for what youre doing for us.\n",
      "5613 The only project I've completed so far is the titanic set. should I even bother putting this into a portfolio seeing as how everyone has seen it before and it has solutions posted?\n",
      "5614 Im new to your channel and loved this video. Thanks for posting these tips!\n",
      "5615 I'm completing my Masters degree in data science in a few days and this video gave me an idea of how I need to set up my CV. Thanks, keep up the good work.\n",
      "5616 Definitely agree with you Ken, the portfolio website is nice and clean, project readme on GitHub are well structured, data visualizations are impressive, great job Pranay!\n",

      "5621 Almost 100k Ken! Keep up the great videos\n",
      "5622 Hey Ken I have two questions regarding CV. Should the projects and work experience be above educational qualifications? Would you recommend a 2-3 pages CV which is much clearer and larger in fonts or a single page CV like that of this guy?\n",
      "5623 Another awesome video in this series. Really liked your suggestion on how to present the most important key point of a project at the top, so anybody can get what its solving in the first 30 seconds to 1 mint. Thanks again Ken for making this video.\n",
      "5624 You make Data Science look sexy \n",
      "5625 Hi Ken. I was recently made redundant and decided to take advantage of the chance to return to the type of work that makes me happy (problem solving). I decided to learn Python and became very interested in data analysis and data science. A few weeks in I found your channel and that is when I really found direction. Thanks. I did have one quick question that I cannot find covered elsewhere in your videos. I like all your advice on CV and LinkedIn information but what would you put as your current job title in my situation (paid for several months but not actually working for an employer). Thanks again for your amazing guidance.\n",
      "5626 Hey Ken, amazing video - I always appreciate your material. Im currently working in a fairly big bank as a data analyst, the job doesnt require the use of very strong programs, excel and Adobe at best. Before I started this job I wasnt 100% on going into DS but now that I am, would you say itd be a good move to do a masters in DS to try and move into more pure blooded data scientist roles? Or is it realistically possible to do that by self teaching with the help of kaggle etc? for context, I have a solid BSc in Maths/Stats so Ive had a little exposure to R and Python. Thanks in advance!\n",

      "5646 Sorry for my second comment and request in the same video, but it would be very nice if you could do a video on the possibilities of transitioning to Data Science coming from a social sciences background beyond economics (sociology, anthropology, history and/or any field that requires analytical thinking and may involve qualitative research). I'm thinking either of a research context (ex masters or PhD students) or simply BS/BA graduates. Thank you again.\n",
      "5647 Congratulations for expanding your channel's scope beyond the US, Ken Jee. You are doing an amazing job. I'd like to thank you in the name of non-US to-be data scientists and ask you, if possible and convenient, to do a video on making it to the Data Science field in the Brazilian context, if it is the case that you already know any successful Brazilian data scientist. Best wishes.\n",
      "5648 Wow! Thank you so much for this! Gave him a follow! :-) Also, I noticed that you have a BS in Economics.

      "5652 Dude I just discovered you but I love your videos. They have been really helpful. I majored in ecnomics and graduated this june and am now doing my masters in quantitative economics and I'm trying to figure out what I need to learn on the side. Thanks for making these!!\n",
      "5653 A question here, Ken: As a beginner, I'm going through lots of books and tutorials to comprehend the concepts of each algorithm and how to apply them, basically using them in a project. Many of the suggested projects for newbies have been done and posted by thousands of people, including bootcamp projects. Even if I do everything on my own thoroughly, it's still the same dataset, project, and approach. I'm wondering if it's ok to add them to my portfolio, at least until I do a little more advanced projects.\n",
      "5654 Man thats goofy. Youre the first person other than me that Ive seen that likes that specific Korean Barbeque jerky. 4:02 when youre making the smoothie\n",
      "5655 Thanks Ken. I really like the idea of tip 3, on focusing on the outcome not the algorithms. I'm guilty of spending all my energy on trying to show off a complex algorithm rather than why I'm doing the project in the first place....i.e. what will it help answer/solve and then how to convey that answer. I'm going to go back and update a few recent projects.\n",
      "5656 Truly a success story! Thank you so much for doing this #KenJee and congrats to Andrew from #dataleap :D keep up the good work!\n",
      "5657 Hey Ken Jee, hope you are doing great. I jave a question, in your opinion how long it takes to become a good data scientist or data analyst for someone who is good in statistics and using excel, beginner in programming, knows the basics of sql, python and tableau\n",
      "5658 I want to ask you a question and hope you will answer. I am willing to be a data scientist. After 3 years, can have a job because i am in a college right now and student of statistics and computer science program. And my question is; will data science job die until i get the job or data science will die in the future?\n",

      "5664 Great interview! As someone from Europe I am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the US, since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online. One small note; at some points in the video, especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low, the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along. Still an awesome discussion tho! :)\n",

      "5688 Just found your channel a few days ago and absolutely love your content! I watched your Data Science Project from sctach series and found it very beneficial. I was wondering if you could make a video targeted at beginners as to what kind of EDA we should be doing depending on our data, maybe explain some of the statistics knowledge needed when picking features to use in models etc (not necessarily how to create plots as you did this in your EDA episode of the ds project series). Thanks for putting out content this useful for free, keep it up man\n",

      "5724 Already the 20th episode, wow! It feels like you just started this series yesterday and now 20 episodes in you covered so many different resumes and projects! I believe in general, talking more about the other side is very valuable in conversation. We as humans just like talking about our own views and when a company is hiring, they of course want to know what they can \"get\" from a candidate.\n",

      "5727 Awesome video Ken! Cool, I'm early today. Great advice on stressing the value that one can bring to an organization. I really like the organization and layout of the \"Hotel Review NLP\" project, great job Ahilan! The class balancing is also a great way to make the classifier less bias, great job! Oh, and nice mechanical keyboard by the way \n",
      "5728 Hello ken. I am a full stack developer and high school student in 12 grade. I have a sound knowledge in this field. I want to be a data scientist. And in front of me there are two options. One is: Go to college and take computer science then learn data science . 2nd one is : Don't go to college and do self study and projects and take some online certificates as data scientist and machine learning engineer and I am ready to give the efforts .But I am kind of confused . Sometime I think I should do self study and real life projects but It also concern be whether it will be a good decision not to go to college. Can you kindly give a advice which will be better because you have a masters degree in computer science. Thank you :)\n",
      "5729 What do you think about codewars/ leetcode? Does it feel relevant to advance coding skills in python to a really high level? For example, does it make sense to invest time to become kata 5 in codewars or to solve medium difficult level in leetcode? Thanks\n",
      "5730 Hello Ken Jee and everyone, I'm an Industrial engineering graduate, so I have good foundation in statistics and its applications. All I want is to solve real world problems through data which is why I'm pursuing data science or to be specific Machine Learning. I'm kindda frustrated because my work right know is just using SQL to make data visualizations for other teams the company I'm working for. I feel that I'm undervaluing myself. I need your advice, what should I do to be able to get a job that actually analyzes data and giving insight into it.\n",

Lets say, if one were to devote a couple of hours every day to work on these ( 2 hours is an guesstimate because at this preliminary stage, most learners are balancing full time job or education ).. I ask this, because I want to follow the path but not have unrealistic expectations and beat myself.. at the same time, I would like to know what a reasonable timeframe for completion would be..\n",
      "5739 Hi Ken! First of all thank you for all the great videos that you are making. I just discovered your channel and I really appreciate it. As I have no internship or education directly link to programming I would like to create a Github page to show to the company that I'm still competent. I'm looking for a job as data analyst in the oil and gas area. Do you have some ideas about projects that I could do? Thank you in advance!\n",
      "5740 Hi Ken! Your videos are tremendously helpful. Thank you. I need some direction please. I was trying to replicate your steps here. When I ran : 'scores = cross_val_score(reg4,x4,y4, cv=5, scoring= 'neg_mean-squared-error')'. Here was the bug I got: ValueError: 'neg_mean-squared-error' is not a valid scoring value.

I want to enter the data science field, but also want to take Math as a major in college. Do you think it would be beneficial for me to take Math as major?\n",
      "5745 Hey man, I was actually wondering if I can also write for your medium publication, I'm really passionate about sports and I could work hours on hours observing statistics in the NBA, NHL, ATP tennis, MLB you name it!

      "5757 Hey ken, I resonated very closely with you on the last point of 'focusing on one imp thing' as for a couple of months i was learning data analytics (sql/tableau/excel etc) and ml and dl(Nlp/Cv) all at same time and was going nowhere even after putting atleast 10hrs everyday. This last point made me realize how important it is to focus on one thing at time. Now i'm going to start with data analytics,find a job and build up from there. Again,thanks Ken\n",
      "5758 Wow...look at those handwritten checklists / notes...the clocks with different time zones...amazing.. Thanks ken for this video, what worked for me is spirituality (Yes I am an Indian), its just enjoying the present moment, and being in the present, that's it....You can't describe in words what sprirtuality does to you, but its just watching the things happening around you, and not being affected by them ( Karma Yoga as it is written in Bhagwat Geeta)\n",
      "5759 Hi Ken, nice video. I really liked the last tip, I've been concious that focusing on one thing could bring in way more results than juggling too may at once. However, I have this irrational fear that I'll lose out on time I could be using to do all of those other things, which is why everything is always top of the priority list.\n",

      "5765 This video was very inspirational in terms of how I can measure my personal success. The pillar of celebrating your successes really spoke to me because I'm in the midst of interviews for internships and after passing some of the initial rounds, I shared my hard work with my supportive friends and this motivated me to study even harder for the final rounds of those interviews. Thanks for the motivational content as always :'))\n",
      "5766 awesome stuff here Ken\n",
      "5767 Hi Ken. Thanks for the videos. I have been watching for a while and just went back to school this fall. Motivation has been a struggle and this video is right on point for me. Your pillars help me realign and rethink my approach to school, day job and child also going to school from home! I have been a data guy for years and figured it is time to formalize by background and experience with a degree. Appreciate your sharing and keep up to solid work!\n",

      "5769 Great content\n",
      "5770 \"Narrowing the scope of things I am trying to learn\" is great advise...another great video ! I learned this the hard way after spending months jumping on to follow every tutorial related to data science I could find on youtube - statistics, data analysis, data visualization, deep learning...etc. It was very overwhelming and didn't do much for my confidence as a beginner. I think it was one of Krish Naik's video called \"How To Learn Data Science Smartly?\" that saved me where he explains why we shouldn't try to learn each aspect of data science separately, but rather find some data science projects and learn different topics with context by reverse engineering.\n",

      "5772 It is awesome and very motivating to see how you evolved so drastically! Thank you a lot for sharing this; about three years ago I also was mostly unproductive and did not get a lot of stuff done. I have been continually trying to make small improvements and I have gotten a long way (but I still have an even longer way to go, of course!) I really paused for a moment when you talked about the aspect of focus. I have been guilty in the past of trying to do 20 different things at the same time and as a result I have experienced dissatisfaction with the outcomes. I will try to narrow my goals down in the future and only focus on one (or very few) different things at a time. When you said, that you don't think you have come far, I wanted to add one detail. I don't remember exactly where I have this \"way of thinking\" from, but it was very inspiring to me. Even if you (as in \"you\" personally) do not feel that you have achieved \"that\" much, it can be motivating to think of people as a network in general. When someone focuses on their own success, they might see that they have done \"average\" or \"somewhat well\", but maybe their actions have affected someone else. And that person affects someone else (else). So while I know the feeling of always trying to achieve more and always wanting to be as successful as possible, I can definitely say that through your channel you have reached a lot of people. And maybe you have influenced 1% or 5% or even more of those people to do something. And maybe those 5% have influenced their own 5% and so on. I know for a fact that you have influenced me for the better and motivated me to start actively trying 66daysofdata and becoming more interested in habit building. So I wanted to say thank you, from me, and for everyone else you influenced at least a little bit. You're awesome! :)\n",
      "5773 one thing i started a few days ago and has helped me a lot is I write down goal for my next day and accomplish atleast one thing early in the morning. this gives me a headstart and once i start the process of completing my goals it becomes significantly easier to fulfill them.\n",
      "5774 Can you Make a Video About writing an article(like medium)? How to Start and How to Write Useful Content with good edit and format.\n",
      "5775 I swear some of the things you said reminded of some of the books you mention: 1. the importance of habits and 2. identity -> Those two go hand in hand together and, one best way to describe oneself is by what we do on a consistant basis. Hence if you can chance your habits, you can chance your identity. The growth mindset has been cited in many different book tough I have \"7 habits of highly successful people\". Motivation clearly sucks as a base strategy, since it's volatile. Don't get me wrong, it's good to have sometimes, but view it rather as a very good friend who has MANY friends, always willing to help, giving a lot of it when it can ... but who can't really always be there on account of having so many people to help .... Motivation is VERY popular these days if you catch my meaning ;) Another thing about identity and accounting, and something I've talked about before, is to give yourself proof of what you've accomplished so far and what you are doing right now ... and a bullet journal, for this and feedback (since ppl won't always be there to give it to you) ... this is perfect for this. Make sure to add the proper tracker to it. And when you feel one of those tracker, that's what Ken Jee here said about about fist pumping and being proud of yourself ... yep, it's very to do that with a tracker and a bullet journal. I can't tell you how many \"YES!!\" I've shouted when marking one ;) PS: #66daysofdata If you watch that video with the intent of applying the advice here to your #66daysofdata ... you might be doing more than 66 of them, and good days they might be just saying ;) (I assume this should count for your challenge in that case). :) PS2: Haven't told you that before, but it seems we have something in common! -> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TnqZl_blT7E :P\n",

I set forth on my learning journey 2 months ago, using MOOCs to have a fair idea of ML. Now I have basic background into different models, plotting, EDA etc. and Python.

      "5817 I agree, this is a very neat and tidy repo, very compact and well documented. Only critism I have is that when I comes to using github in the real world the developer/data scientist will need a good understanding of working with development, staging and production branches which is not demonstrated here. In addition, when it comes to deploying models through cloud services such as aws it is more secure to have everything in its own repo\n",

      "5879 Hi Ken. I'm looking to transition into data science over the course of the next year or two if possible. I have around 8 years experience in digital media, so there is somewhat of a narrative of \"data analysis\" that I can build on - though that analysis was limited to digital media analytics platforms. The job has given me an edge in terms of communication, presentation-building, etc., but that's where my advantages end. My undergrad is in a non-quantitative major (sport management). I have zero calculus at this time. I spent the first 3 years of my career in sales. And I cannot afford to take an internship at any point throughout the remainder of my career. I'm currently taking the Data Analysis nanodegree program with Udacity, and getting a really good handle on the analytics toolkit. The programming is coming easier than I expected. From there I was thinking of self-studying the math, and doing the Udacity Data Science nanodegree to start to get the DS foundation. I think I have a reasonable shot of moving into the analytics department at my current agency within the next year. I can start to build a DS portfolio around that time as well. With that context - do you suggest I go masters, boot camp, certificate, or continued self-study after that?\n",

      "5888 That 365datascience site is pretty disingenuous in that a number of locations on its site it says \"Earn a data science degree at your own pace\" & \"Earn your degree at a fraction of the cost\". There's no indication this site is accredited by any major recognized body or that their program is accepted as part of any actual degree program. As comparison look at Statistics.com where they do actually have accredited courses accepted towards a Data Science degree.\n",
      "5889 This video was great! I have found some frustration from \"not understanding a topic\" but not looking for a different explanation. For example, I struggled to understand what a p-value is and how it is useful; to understand what the p-value was, I found a statistics textbook and read about it. I still didn't understand and felt doomed to never understand p-values. Using your approach of looking for more resources, I was able to get a better understanding of it! It is a great idea to see a topic explained in different ways and by different sources. Thank you for bringing this technique up! Thanks for the video Ken!\n",

      "5911 Yessss....you're the best Kenn. This is really awesome. 1st time I feel that I can actually break the iceberg to become a data scientist\n",
      "5912 Thanks amen! I appreciate you helping others learn faster and more efficiently. I havent seen all the resources but itll be great you posting more resources to find codes other have built! Looking forward to more!\n",
      "5913 This is amazing! Thank you\n",
      "5914 Thanks ken for being you :)\n",
      "5915 Hi ken jee thanks for the video Just a quick question how much tensorflow and tableau needed for a data science job?\n",
      "5916 Bro, I am a developer who is thinking to learn but while thinking got stuck much places. Without knowing basis how need to move like that I thought. Basics is completely theoretical. Your way is awesome to learn tq so much. I can use this in different field also. I am doing the 66 day challenge even got confusing. You cleared my way which need to proceed. Do well like these videos much. Thank you so much.\n",
      "5917 Thank u sir for this video You clear all my doubts.\n",
      "5918 KenJee, could talk about github repos that are great exemples of very well coded end-to-end data science projects?\n",
      "5919 I watch some kind of Data Science videos everyday , so that is why you are in my recommendations a lot . But this particular night I suddenly got really anxious that I wouldnt be good enough , and your video popped up at the same moment and I clicked instantly because I wanted to feel some wave of calmness . Does this come of as creepy? Sorry about that ! ! But yeah, Im calmer now . :) eeps\n",
      "5920 Hey Ken, Hope you are doing well. Thanks for an awesome video. I recently started following your videos and the content is too good. I had a query related to the career options. I am an experienced professional working on SAP BW (data warehousing solutions), and lately I have developed interest in learning python to add to my skill set. Since I am related to analytics, I wanted to know how fine it would be for me to move into field of data science or data engineering. Any suggestions is highly appreciated. Btw thanks for accepting my connection request on LinkedIn.\n",
      "5921 Exactly what I was looking for Thank you man\n",
      "5922 On one hand I really love your channel and I dont want it to become mainstream but on the other hand I really hope you will be rewarded for the effort & quality that comes with these videos. - So here you get a comment for the algorithm :D Starting my Data Science Bachelor soon & your videos are like steroids for my motiviation :) Keep it up man!\n",
      "5923 Thanks KEN keep up the good work!\n",
      "5924  Practical Tips FOR THE WIN\n",
      "5925 I am just a beginner and not an expert, but I think beginners should take the first notebook(by Pedro Marcelino) with a pinch of salt. There are some things I found very wrong in this notebook: 1. You don't always need to drop multicollinear variables. 1 most widely used model in Kaggle is XGBoost and it is immune to multicollinearity. I think, so are other random forest like models. 2. Dropping a variable because it has more than 15% missing data is a bad idea. This threshold is too much in my humble opinion. There are more things which much more experience Data Scientists have pointed out in comments section. I am not saying it's entirely useless but it is not great to follow it 100%. It has maximum votes but maybe it's just an outliar in Kaggle's dataset of Notebooks.\n",
      "5926 Great video Ken! Your daily progress updates on discord motivates me even more. Thank you for doing this\n",
      "5927 I really love this initiative! It really motivates me everyday to know that thousands of others are also learning the field! I think reviewing notebooks is a great idea and I'll definitely do that as well in future days-of-data, for now I'll focus on the theory first. Let's build some habits!\n",
      "5928 Thank you, you answered the exact question I had, how to best go about this.\n",
      "5929 Thanks for watching everyone! Keep up the great work with the #66DaysOfData Challenge! More info on that here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uXLnbdHMf8w&ab_channel=KenJee 0:00 Intro 1:30 Why is it important to learn from other's code? 4:04 My approach 5:18 Example\n",
      "5930 Excellent tips \n",
      "5931 This will be what I do\n",
      "5932 Wow. Best video Ive seen for learning date science / analysis\n",
      "5933 This is a highly valuable and useful video! Thanks a ton Ken!\n",
      "5934 Great video Ken! Learning from other people's code is a great way to learn. Another great way to learn for me is code reviewing where for example some of my colleague or students would send over their code as a Jupyter notebook where I would go over the code, figure out how the ML model workflow could be improved, could be faster, could add some areas of novelty, etc. such that the resulting research paper would have a chance for publication in a scientific journal. Afterwards, I would have discussion with the person who wrote the code and together we can learn from one another on the rationale for choosing a specific approach and whether some component could be adjusted to provide better performance, new areas of novelty, etc. On another note, Amazing video editing (pattern interrupts ), also noticed that you're using Notion as placeholders for the code, great tips! (Wow, I've just noticed how long this comment has become)\n",
      "5935 Hi, I have completed masters in Statistics and Learn Data Science. I am curious about job opportunity's in you country. And i want to learn more knowledge from you. Please help me. Hope you replay to this when you see.\n",
      "5936 I have already undertaken Coursera's IBM data science professional certificate and about to finish it this week. As a beginner I learnt a lot but feel there is still a long way to go!! Do you think this certificate and projects of my own will help me fetch a job in this field? I would really appreciate if you reply!!!\n",
      "5937 ofcos he didnt look good\n",
      "5938 I love hands-on learning\n",
      "5939 I thought that I hate this field but you help me to realize how much I still love this field and I quit my meaningless and bad job to be better and learn more because that job didn't make me a better data scientist. You even inspire me to write articles. thank you so much.\n",
      "5940 thanks man! This is helping me unblock things in my head, and allows me to keep my own personal #66daysofdata alive :) Plus, I already wanted to check the very notebook you're showing there (since I am doing a lot of this uncooperative House regression thingy). It also an important lesson since, so far, I wanted to take pride into trying to build my own model alone from scratch without external help ... well, I guess I came as far as I could with this method which your video is helping me understand :)\n",
      "5941 I think this is actually an incredible idea\n",
      "5942 You are such an inspiration to us!! Thanks for motivating us :)\n",
      "5943 Bro. This is top. Maybe you have already said it and I'm mistaken, but I haven't been able to find it in your videos. What kind of projects would you recommend for getting a data ANALYST job (I've seen the data scientist recommendations, but I suppose they are not the same). I would really appreciate it, although I know you are busy. Thank you for everything ;-)\n",
      "5944 Love your content! Willing to start the #66DaysofData Kudos!!!!!!!!\n",

      "5954 I found the MEAP Maths for Programmers (with Python examples) very rewarding to getting into using algorithms. It avoids the typical pitfall whereby a maths book starts almost condescendingly slow, then out of nowhere, introduces formulas as if you should know them innately from birth.\n",
      "5955 Thank you Ken! Ive been digging through your channel lately and its great. I graduated with a degree in mechanical engineering but I really want to go into the data science space. Would you suggest getting a masters?\n",
      "5956 Hi! I am new to Data Science. I have a Civil Engineering Degree and a MBA. I also understand how to develop algorithms with my knowledge in C and C++ (unfortunately this was over 10 yrs ago), I have maintained the knowledge to develop algorithms, not so much the language. I was taught to visual the problem and find what are constants and what will be the variables. I had also used Matlab in college to write a code to solve triple integrals...which was far easier to do than solving it by hand. I also understand statistics and have 13 years of engineering experience. I have decided to start with learning Python. I am going the self taught method. Is there some good resources you can recommend, textbooks, free webinars, professional societies, communities and methods to building a portfolio.\n",
      "5957 Thank you for sharing your advice!!\n",
      "5958 Great video!!! But I wish you mentioned some edx and coursera courses even !!\n",
      "5959 Interesting journey :) It's really a great interview, Ken. Thanks for sharing with us!!\n",
      "5960 When you say you will start Kaggle projects, which projects in particular will you be attempting?\n",
      "5961 Is data science mainly used to do evil such as face recognition and surveillance in communist China? I've just completed first and second stage working on C++, and I'm presently doing research for next stage of study.\n",
      "5962 Hey there!! Thanks for such a great content!!! But I still have a few questions; If I have opportunity to choose between Data Science and Computer science major then which one will be better? (Even for ML Engineer jobs ) And do you like to advice me on working destinations for data scientist employees among: Zrich, US, Australia\n",
      "5963 Amazing interview! Tina really is a motivating force as well, it's just amazing to see how people, even from non-cs backgrounds, make a transition into software engineering, or in this case, even data science. Thank you for the helpful content!\n",

I started the Titanic problem on kaggle, and I'm working my way towards a solution. Is this a good way to study? Look for problems and then Google/read your way towards a working solution. I tend to stick to traditional ways of studying-- do all the theory at once and then get to problem solving. Please please please respond with your thoughts!\n",

      "6031 Hi Ken! Loving this idea. I actually just started the data analyst in python pathway on dataquest a couple days ago after realizing I needed to up my skills if I really wanted to become involved with data analytics/science in the future, so perfect timing. This is an amazing initiative, and although I don't have twitter, I will be following along on your other socials (linkedin/YT) trying to connect with fellow data lovers!\n",
      "6032 Looking to follow your journey. Ive just started a post grad course on Data Science and been watching your vids for a lot of help and resources. Thanks man! Good timing that youre doing this!\n",
      "6033 hey ken quick question. When describing ones skills with ML on the resume, is it better to name specific models, or more general techniques? i.e Skills: Machine Learning (linear regression, svm, PCA, etc...) vs. Skills: Machine Learning (Regression, Classification, Dimensionality Reduction etc..). Thanks for all the videos you put out, and thanks for reading!\n",

      "6039 Thanks bro!\n",
      "6040 I feel that incorporating good questions into videos would be good. That way people dont ask the same question over and over again. Also good questions wont get lost as videos get older.\n",
      "6041 Hi. I have learned some basics of scikit learn and machine learning, is there any specific source you would recommend for learning more of data handling and preprocessing? Thanks : )\n",
      "6042 Hi ken, do you think a github portfolio is better than a personal website that contains all your information and projects ? Or should I do both. Thank you\n",
      "6043 Hi Ken, Thank you for this video. I am new to your channel. For past month or so, I have been going through your videos to learn more about data science and how to break in to this field. I have a Bachelors in Electrical Engineering, and have worked as Business Intelligence Developer for past few years. I am hoping to make it to data science field :). I have been taking some free courses that you have suggested over the past month (brushed up on my stats, finished two of the Kaggle courses (more in progress), etc.). I really want to thank you for taking the time to provide guidance to those of us who are new to data science field. I also want to thank you for pushing people like me to break out of their shell and go public :).\n",
      "6044 I am currently an Electrical Engineer and I always felt that my strongest side was in programming and mathematics. I always struggled with the hardware side of EE and was looking to change into another major. What are your opinions on a switch to DS? I have taken Statistics before and enjoyed the class as a tid bit.\n",
      "6045 Wow, I actually haven't seen this one repo - multiple projects folders approach so far; that's a pretty neat idea! Also it would be great if you answer comments at the end of the video, given that there are relevant questions of course. I think that would put even more information into your already very informative videos! Speaking of questions: Here's one: So I watched your Udemy course and how you talked about reaching out to recruiters or just in general experienced people and how you should try to schedule a call within a specific timeframe. You also said it's always a good idea to try and give \"something back\", so to offer to the other person some sort of help. My question would be, what type of help can someone offer, when they are a student or just in general less experienced? Oh and I'm excited for the 66 days of data science! :) Personally I'll probably go for 66 days of machine learning engineering haha\n",
      "6046 Towards a being better data scientist\n",
      "6047 Take one question and a 2-5 minute segment on it would be cool at the end of the video. Even throw in an example. Cheers!\n",
      "6048 Again, special thanks to Darwin for submitting his gitub profile! If you would like to have your projects, resumes, portfolios, or linkedin reviewed for a video, please comment below and send me an email at kenjee.ds@gmail.com! Discord for #66DaysOfData https://discord.gg/VXSUJYJ\n",

      "6052 great idea. Im super interested.\n",
      "6053 Hello Ken! I want to thank you for all the great videos you provide that really help us, the ones that are interested in entering the field of data science. I saw a video of yours where you suggested that for landing a job in the field it's good to have like 4 projects: using regression, classification, clustering, and DL or NLP. My question is after I saw the great work Darwin did, is it enough to just focus on like 2 projects or 1 that are/is in our field of interest is? That maybe the number of projects doesn't matter but the quality and the way you present them do? Thank you!\n",

      "6070 Edit: maybe just ignoring the sci-kit info for now? I think I'm in a position where I actually need to learn a lot and I am curious about R specific resources I just started a new job (entry level) at a startup and I only know R. I'm currently building out pipelines and other processes and I wanted to know if you had any resources that would be helpful for the 66 days\n",

      "6075 Is it on youtube only? If so I'll love it\n",
      "6076 After watching this conversation and doing some careful consideration (including trying Datacamp vs. Dataquest) I ended up subscribing to a month of Dataquest and am really happy a week in. The context was that even though I had done a self-instruction path of working on projects, including for my current clients, I realized there were major holes in my fundamentals on both Python and R. So even though I currently have projects I do every day using Pandas, R, and SQL, working in combination for real-world results, I was doing things like Leetcode and realizing my Python basics were really shaky. Based on this interview in your video, and your feedback about value of looking for free resources vs. paying to have it all in one place, organized well, and with a good teaching tool, I opted to try this for a month. I was immediately paid back with learning almost all of the exact things I had questions about or was missing in my current knowledge. I was also very impressed with the curriculum on Dataquest and feel it is worth the monthly payments right now to very quickly acquire a base standard of data science knowledge that is in some ways 1:1 with current standard practices and knowledge. Given your 66 days of data science challenge coming up, I think it was fortunate timing for my own ongoing efforts to pivot to this field from my current area of expertise, online programmatic ad ops. Interviews like this really do provide a lot of value for those of us looking for answers and realistic, and honest, appraisals of solutions. Thanks again!\n",
      "6077 Great initiative! I'll be following along! Just started with Kaggle micro courses.\n",
      "6078 I'll join the challenge! Accountability is helpful when learning online. Tomorrow's tasks include setting goals, creating a calendar/roadmap, and signing up for twitter. I'm interested to see the journey from different perspectives.\n",
      "6079 Hey Ken!Thanks for the tips; Im steadily habituating many of these practices, and with greater intention after watching the video. Question: what are you using that small whiteboard on your desk for? I have a similar one that Im trying to determine a purpose for. . .\n",
      "6080 Hi Ken, I am an Entrepreneur in manufacturing and holds a masters degree in manufacturing as well. Due to pandemic I had to close my business and am looking for opportunities in data science. I have completed few courses including the zero to mastery course by Daniel bourke which helped me create a lot of interest in this field. I am hoping to relate data science with manufacturing. Can you advise me about the same. Is it possible to find a job in data science as I am from a different educational background?\n",
      "6081 I too feel \"stuck\" which is why I also will be participating in #66daysofdata. Time to buckle down and get focused for September!\n",

      "6115 I really want to follow on this initiative, but have a question. I have already taken the Kaggle micro courses (Python, Pandas, Data Visualization, and Intro to Machine Learning). Is that okay if I already have somewhat of a headstart? I am starting to learn now some machine learning, but with a different book. It is from O'Reilly and called Introduction to Machine Learning with Python (another book I can recommend and a bit tight on buying new books). Would that be ok?\n",
      "6116 This is so great. I really need to brush up and get motivated!\n",
      "6117 Really excited about this\n",
      "6118 I love this Ken, this is so thoughtful of you!! Would be starting with you\n",
      "6119 Thanks for the recommendations Ken! I really appreciate it. I want to dive into machine learning, but my math and statistics knowledge are not good enough yet. Do you think the book Think Stats is a good book to learn statistics basics? After learning statistics, the book Hands On Machine Learning is good for beginners?\n",
      "6120 Thank you for this ! Im want to learn Data Science but the boot camp is too expensive for me right now (17K) . Im in a free camp for software engineering so Im finally starting to learn tech . I hope next year with this and Coursea hopefully I can make my break in data science . There arent a lot of black people in the field it seems so Im nervous \n",

      "6129 i am so fucking pumped dude\n",
      "6130 I bought the 365 data science complete bootcamp on udemy. Would that work along with your initiative?\n",
      "6131 Hi Ken Thank you so much, you came from havean for me. I started learning just around a month ago (Im lost .....) for me as an electrical engineer (Industrial: oil & gas), data science like different planet. my mathematical background is very strong, but coding experience is absolute zero. I found myself really taken by data science. For now, i focus only on Python, (we will see the rest after that) check out freecodecamp.org, they have a very great program with free certificate. their YouTube videos made by university doctors Great Job Hero Believe me, Im cheering for you man, like you made a triple points with a big dunk. \"Ken.. Jee hoo hoo\" \"Ken.. Jee hoo hoo\" \"Ken.. Jee hoo hoo\"\n",
      "6132 Great initiative! Would there be a slack or discord channel where people who want to follow you on this journey can update?\n",
      "6133 For anyone thinking about learning the skills for a data science career, or even as a personal hobby, Johns Hopkins University created a pay-what-you-want training series of 11 courses targeting beginners. You do not have to be a complete novice to benefit from these courses; get your feet wet or whet your appetite - whichever analogy you prefer. https://leanpub.com/universities/set/jhu/cloud-based-data-science\n",
      "6134 Hello Ken, I think this is a really positive move! Refreshing your knowledge is always something beneficial and I think this will be great both for you and of course for your audience. Since I also wanted to widen my horizon for a bit now I'll try to take out that bit of time out of my day and learn as well! (I don't acutally use Twitter but I'll just keep track regardless) Happy learning! :)\n",
      "6135 Commenting before the vid ends just to address the wink at 2:42. That was a nice touch lol.\n",
      "6136 Hey Ken! What about setting up a discord server so the community can better help each other and communicate! Thanks a lot for this man! Keep it up!\n",
      "6137 Hi Ken, could you post your daily work on LinkedIn as well besides Twitter?\n",
      "6138 #66daysofdata thats a fantastic idea Ken ! I was using Daniel Bourke's 42 day learning strategy, which worked so well for me. As a beginner, this strategy helped me to not waste time getting overwhelmed by the vast areas of topics to learn in data science. I just picked some basic projects to focus and learn using reverse engineering for 42 days and it was a fruitful endeavor. Looking forward to learn with you man ! :)\n",
      "6139 It's rare people accept the downsides publically... Good wishes Ken Jee..\n",
      "6140 Hey Ken Thanks a lot for taking this initiative. I'll definitely join you up. Just wanted to make a suggestion here It'll be great if you can make a whatsapp group by the end of this course so that we can have a community of people on similar stag in their data science journey and they can colobrate from there and take it forward by doing more projects. Again thanks for doing this! Really excited\n",
      "6141 Hey ken! I dont have twitter. Do you have a discord group where we can collaborate as a community, share progress, learn and motivate each other? :)\n",
      "6142 Bro, From Where Should I Start Software Development skills ie Excelling Python or From Mathematics or Directly Jump on To Data Science Concepts. Recently it has been over a Month or two fro me Programming in Python and I think I am at SOMEWHAT intermediate Level. Please Suggest Me..\n",
      "6143 I think one of the biggest obstacles of learning python is actually practicing the syntax and memorizing the many different functions needed to code. Any websites youre using to practice the syntax/functions and solving given problems that are common when using python?\n",
      "6144 Thanks a lot sir , for doing so much for us . You are the best . \n",
      "6145 let's go!\n",
      "6146 I can't thank you enough for this man!! I will be honest, I didn't have a friend to prepare for Data Science with and I was looking desperately for someone, and who he turned out to be, it was Ken Jee! The same person from whom I understood what Data Science basically is! And I owe you, big time man! Thank you, thank you so much!!!! I will surely keep you updated on my progress! Thank you once again, my man! Thank you!\n",
      "6147 Hi Ken! This initiative is amazing! Are you going to upload videos during the 66 days? Or just sharing the process through your Twitter account?\n",
      "6148 I am up.\n",

      "6151 Will you also upload YouTube videos on what you are learning?\n",
      "6152 I was feeling stuck in my learning, so this video is an excellent incentive to move forward with my projects.\n",
      "6153 The #66DaysofData learning / relearning initiative comes at the ideal time. I start a geospatial data analytics graduate-level program after Labour Day.\n",
      "6154 Twitter, why not LinkedIn??\n",
      "6155 Lets do this\n",
      "6156 I'll be following! Thank you!\n",
      "6157 The \"Hands On ML with Keras & Tensorflow\" is indeed really good. I am enjoying it as well. Talk about getting you to do stuff, the book doesn't lead with the data processing but goes straight to the analysis. It was a deliberate move by the author to get your interest before talking about some of the other necessities.\n",
      "6158 Hello Ken. looking forward to learning data science with you.\n",
      "6159 Hi Ken, this is so exciting for me. Really looking forward to this initiative and I just wanted to ask why twitter and not Linkedin? for posting the daily updates :) #66DaysOfData\n",

      "6169 Waiting for this from a Long time..\n",
      "6170 Can you create a video comparing data science or fields of DS and Actuary\n",
      "6171 Hi Ken I actually worked on building a simple Youtube Video categorization model using just the title and description. When I plotted those text metadata using a T-SNE plot I could see that videos from the same category where not compressed together rather they were scattered around forming occasional blobs of different category videos clustered together. So, I wanted to know that how does Youtube actually categorize its videos because 'title+description' doesnt seem to be very specific. Link - https://github.com/2000siddharth/web_scraping_classification/blob/master/EDA_YT.ipynb Thanks for always making amazing content.\n",
      "6172 Soo excited\n",
      "6173 Can you add linear algebra as well? It is taught in Applied.ai course and I'm searching for resources to learn it and haven't found anyone yet...\n",
      "6174 This video was a huge shot of motivation. I've been using the past couple of months to begin my own journey towards working in the Data Analytics field since losing my job to COVID. This interview was extremely helpful in reinforcing some of the things I was already doing as well as making me aware of the things I wasn't. Congratulations to Ray on his success in breaking into the Data Analytics field and thank you to Ken for providing such helpful content in this area.\n",
      "6175 Finally 66 days of data is here!!!!!? I have started to upload #dataset on #kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/akhandpratap/pm-narendra-modi-tweets-during-pandemic\n",

      "6177 Hello Ken, great to see this. Do we have any prerequisites for this serie? I have taken a Stats class, a Intro to Datascience class, and have some experience with R, is it enough to follow along. Thank you Ken \n",
      "6178 I'm getting the follwing error: 'IMapUnorderedIterator' object has no attribute Please advise.\n",
      "6179 Woo! Excited to follow along on this one :) Revising the basics will never be a bad idea. Let's do this!\n",
      "6180 want to start data science in the right path show us ken\n",
      "6181 Really looking forward to this!! I hope you can also touch upon how important it is to learn about deployment/pipelines, and if so, how we should go about it.\n",
      "6182 I'm so excited for this, patiently waiting \n",
      "6183 Just the thing I wanted.\n",
      "6184 Speaking of which, related to my comment below, a message for the followers of Ken jee: How about meeting on a regular basis on Kaggle and talking about our progresses? And, of course, help each other out, share notes and, even better, work together on a project once we're good enough one of these days? :) PS: a discord chat with voice might also be useful, and I am willing to help establish it, just in case :)\n",
      "6185 I am already in the process of taking not just the habits of doing ML every day (that's a requirement I think when you're beginning and new in the field) but als, recently, I started using my Bullet Journal to record my investment and progress into the field. And since I am still trying to sort out a few things both in tracking my progress and trying to establish a clearer road map, seeing this on my computer this morning came as an incredibly great blessing, thank you !! :) Now question: Could you and us the rest of your community also have some discussion on, say, Kaggle on regular basis? I feel like that, for newcomers like me, it would help navigate the kaggle \"maelstrom\" and be less intimidated, as well as having a clearer road map. As for you, it would help you both reexamine your fundemantals through teaching as well as helping you establish yourself as a good, proficient teacher that has both passion for the field and is teaching it with the best of intentions. :) And I assume when we, your followers and students, start becoming proficient and say 'Ken Jee was instrumental in this' ... well ... I am really hoping this will open doors for you, the best ones, just saying ;)\n",
      "6186 super excited ....lets rock it ken\n",

      "6231 Hello Ken! I am in a very fortunate spot where I have the option to attain an accelerated masters degree completely free! It is a 5 year program Co-Terminal. With that being said I am going to be attending Illinois ITech and would love to know your thoughts on attaining an accelerated masters in Computer science or Data Science. The pros and cons between the two. I am acquiring a bachelors in Computer science and am wondering if it would be more beneficial to acquire the data science degree with the Internship opportunities down town Chicago or master in CS. I am intrigued in both computer science and data science but I lean towards mastering in data because I feel like a bachelors in CS is already enough. But some people have said that a masters in CS is viewed as more valuable, respectable and versatile. Anyways your expert opinion would be great !please\n",

      "6265 Hey Ken, I was not sure if you saw the response I made on your scraping glassdoor video. But here is the code that scrapes the titles of glass door. The main advantages are that it is more efficient(code wise) and it is much faster then selenium. I also did this in beautiful soup which Is not a super scalable library, but it illustrates the power of scraping tools. If you want to scale on a larger level, I recommend learning scrapy. Additionally, there is also a tool available that lets you select the exact css element of a web-page I will re-link it again. Anyways, here is the code that scrapes the job titles for glassdoor. from bs4 import BeautifulSoup from urllib.request import urlopen,Request import pandas as pd import random import pickle headers = {\"User-Agent\": \"Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/41.0.2228.0 Safari/537.3\"} website = \"https://www.glassdoor.com/Job/data-scientist-jobs-SRCH_KO0,14.htm\" for i in range(1): req = Request(website, headers=headers) page = urlopen(req) soup = BeautifulSoup(page, 'html.parser') for item in soup.select(\".jobLink span\"): print(item.get_text()) Lastly, you may be wondering how to go to different pages with the code and how you can scrape elements that are not on the front page of the website. Well to answer the former, you would implement a technique called pagination (I will link an article for this) and for the latter, you would scrape each link on the website and iterate through each page collecting all the elements contained on each page.\n",
      "6266 How about data analytics? I studied computer science and I feel that I'm not confident in programming yet. And I feel that Data Science needs more programming and statistics than Data analytics. So, should I start with Data analytics? thoughts?\n",

      "6272 i feel bad about my projects now. this is amazing\n",
      "6273 I don't think these kind of \"secrets\" are taking credibility from data scientists. It is not about memorizing every bit of code. It's about knowing how to get help and knowing what you are looking for.\n",
      "6274 Hey Ken, can you recommend the best universities to get a master's degree in DS?\n",
      "6275 I watch your videos that are awesome. I am a biggner and want to learn data science form very zero. Soo.. plz tell me from where I should start my journey?\n",

      "6299 Congrats Ken on the 80k! Alexander's portfolio website looks really nice and clean. The Trivago project looks amazing. It is very nicely structured and goes into great depth into the underlying math as well as summarizing the key findings in several data visualization plots. It almost looks like a research paper, perhaps it would be nice to format it as a research paper (Key sections: Abstract, Introduction, Materials & Methods, Results & Discussion, Conclusion, Acknowledgements, References) and upload to arXiv.org as a preprint, might even look good in the resume also \n",
      "6300 Very nice! Employers will line up from now on ;-) Good luck Alexander!\n",
      "6301 Do you have a video on where to start on your data science journey. I have less than one year to graduate from university and Im majoring in data analytics. My university just recently made the data science major so I wasnt able to declare it. I may just be overwhelmed... any help is appreciated!\n",
      "6302 I learned python during the quarantine. I also want to make projects that got me into the data science field though I'm not familiar with ml concepts, I'm learning them. I want some project ideas that I could add to my resume. Right now I'm doing some beginners level project like Titanic survival and wine quality one. But I want projects that could get me jobs. Any idea where I can search for them?\n",
      "6303 Ive been meaning to send you mine but Im terrified of being roasted publicly\n",
      "6304 I put this message here, since it's your last video. I was wondering if you will do a video on the following subject: How to interact on kaggle to attract the attention of other people, the kind that are helpful and, likewise, how can a newbie, like me, make a contribution ourselves as beginners on kaggle. And in general, what are the best ways to interact on the platform. I ask because I believe finding some form of mentor-ship from experienced people is one of biggest key or advantages you can get in learning any field, but ML in particular ( your youtube videos and frank kane courses from sundog are good example). Of course, gaining some kind of a more direct mentor-ship goes hand in hand with yourself being able to help and make contributions in return (which seems the whole philosophy being kaggle) so I was wondering if you would be willing to share a few secrets there. ( I fully admit that it looks a bit intimidating at first sight :) ). In any case, thanks for your youtubes videos :)\n",
      "6305 Hi Ken, you recommended having some sort of data collection element involved in our projects but how would you show that? Other than including the datasets in your project files & explaining in a writeup, is there any way to show people what your data collection process is? Also, would you be able to make a video on working with big data / hadoop sometime in the future (if that's something you've had experience with)?\n",

I'm from the midwest US and really want to see the more mundane and less glamorous jobs that are out here, since I don't want to leave behind my family and friends and life in indiana to chase a dream job. I know someone who works as a data analyst for CANON and a lot of his work is SQL queries and relational databases and excel spreadsheets. Don't get me wrong -- your job looks amazing -- but it looks really competitive (like 200+ applications per job for these sorts of things) and something that would be near impossible with my background in the humanities. edit: You know, I just re-read this comment and it sounded rude.

      "6339 Hi Ken, Thank you very much for sharing these info!! I am following you as a guide for my Data Science journey, so I really appreciate everything you do! Currently I am an account Manager but I feel burning in me the love for data science. Data are my daily bread, so I would like to manage data in a deep way and creating new value by doing it. I agree that the best way for learning Data Science is by doing projects, so do you think that the best could be finding projects for \"beginners\" on Kaggle or it could be better to do Kaggle projects without any kind of \"limit\" (so in this case just with the purpose of increasing skills by doing different kind of data analysis)? Thank you again Ken and have a great day :)\n",
      "6340 Hi Ken. I hope you are well. Thank you for the great deal of work you are doing to help here. I was trying to replicate this video on my own on Spyder. When I tried \"7\" and \"x= 7\".

      "6341 Hey Ken, what are some good reads you recommended for building Data science knowledge? Ill be going to Kaggle eventually as you mentioned. Im at a community college learning c++ for the AS in Computer Science then transferring to a 4YR and getting the BS in Data Science and will learn python and R.\n",
      "6342 Sounds like clustering models (unsupervised) can be used to design database tables\n",
      "6343 Thank you Ken for your contents. I recently got 365 data science course with your discount link because I noticed some basic knowledge gap from learning in an unstructured manner. I hope to polish my skills and get a job before the year winds up. Thank you!\n",

      "6345 Hey ken, if you ever plan to make videos teaching data science concepts or any sort of tutorials but you are struggling with time, try live streaming. It will save so much time of yours since you don't have to edit them + you can interact with us guys more often.\n",
      "6346 Hi, ken. I really like your voice. I'm not a native English speaker and your video really helps me speak like a Data engineer. HAHA. I'm doing my master's degree in Data Science/AI. Personally speaking, my college's courses and many resources like Andrew NG's lecture mainly focusing on mathematical theories. If there are courses about job seeking, it is really useful for me : ) Thank you for your awesome content!\n",

      "6348 Hi Ken, I saw your course in it as i had already bought a one year package. as my boot camp starts in a fortnight, i am desperate for time to get my machine leaning code done in kaggle datasets. i will go through your course after the bootcamp. i am currently undergoing kaggle mini-courses to get going. the new visualisation course in 365 also i on-holding it, lol. i watch your titanin walkthrough, several times, its great. but it is too high level for us beginners. i am trying the easier one on estonia. i wonder if you could do something like titanic on a much simplier dataset, for those really beginners out there and me. i like your voice, tone, speed. its really easy to understand. i like 365, its guide learners very well. but then we need more practise on datasets, there is where kaggle comes in. but its overwhelming for beginners too. there are too much to learn to roam around in kaggle, so i took the mini-course to learn how to get its data, and to submit. Thanks for the contents. i watch everyone of it\n",

Interviews like this are extremely helpful for those of us looking to get further into data science, both from a motivational perspective (someone did it, here's proof) and an instructional perspective (here's a way someone did it, it worked for them, here's why and how). Thank you again for doing this.\n",

      "6374 My college is sponsoring all courses on Coursera till end of September and I'm completing courses and their assignments for about 6-8hrs a day. I have so many personal projects in mind which I wanna do but I'm not able to decide should I stop taking those courses and just do my projects instead? I'm learning new stuff all the time through those courses and they great. Currently completing the 'Applied Data Science with Python Specialization' and I plan on doing the Deep Learning Specialization after completing this one, what do you think I should do? Thanks for reading till the end.\n",
      "6375 I'm doing the Data Science Professional Certification by IBM on Coursera. What's your opinion on it? I really hope it's worth it. I'm at course 5 out of a total of 9. Started just 1.5 months ago and I'm overwhelmed by the amount of topics I need to learn. One thing that really bothers me is that I don't know how deeply I need to understand a particular topic. For example, python. Numpy, pandas, etc. How much of it is required to be able to work effectively with data? Any suggestions Ken?\n",

      "6389 Hey Ken, to be honest, I (sort of) knew that you were working with 365, but I didn't know that you created an entire course for this. It is very good to see that you really try to create as much value as possible! I think this course will really benefit a lot of people. Btw: If a hypothetical person would be in the hypothetical position that they already have their portfolio set up and basically only want to lern about how to network in this field and get their foot into the door, especially for more of a machine learning engineering, rather than DS role, do you think this course would be a good fit? ( Maybe I'll buy it anyway tho, just to support you ;) )\n",

      "6403 That's so creative Francis!\n",
      "6404 Hey Ken I just wanted to say thank you for creating this channel and the content on it...I always had an interest in Data Science but felt like it had such a high barrier to entry for me I never really thought much of doing it..After graduating with my Bachelors in CS last year however I'll be entering grad school in a week for Data Science specifically with an intended goal to get into Sports Analytics for Baseball...and having only discovered your channel a week ago I've been binging a lot of your videos on Data Science and Sports Analytics and am really thankful for all the great information you provide in all of the videos!...I've been following quite a few CS/Software YouTube channels the past few years but always wished i could find a Data Science/Sports Analytics channel so stumbling upon your channel was awesome to have happen!\n",
      "6405 This is a useful video to introduce newbie like me when we're ready to start our own projects. In fact, and since I've started your\"Data science project from scratch\" series, it seems like this one, or a remade one (it seems the sound is a bit lower here, mic issues?) , this video or kind or video would be ideal for an episode \"zero\" of \"Data Science project from scratch\".\n",
      "6406 Thats a great video. I have been following your channel and love your work and its precise content. Inspiring me in my data science path.Great Stuff.Thank you Ray Ojel for sharing your journey. Its of great help! Thanks Pal! And all the very best! Thanks Ken.\n",
      "6407 What he said about \"not understanding Kaggle notebook\" is very relatable! I'm a software developer and I started taking interest in data science. When I read other people's work on Kaggle the first time, I got discouraged because I didn't understand their thought process. As I started doing more courses online through Kaggle, taking other courses, and just playing around with some dataset, I slowly began to understand other people's work. All that is to say: be patient, keep learning and keep tinkering with datasets. It's a marathon not a sprint. You will be surprised by your progress. :)\n",

      "6412 feeling so much positive , thanks ken jee\n",
      "6413 What would you recommend for learning Excel skills for Data Analysis (some book or course, doesn't matter)? Learned Basics of Python/IPython, NumPy, started Pandas and then checked vacancies in my country and find out that for Entry Level in Data Analyst usually required Excel (pivot tables, DAX formulas, Power Query) and SQL (+ PowerBI, but it usually not in \"must have section\").\n",
      "6414 In 37:40 ish , you copied the code from above and edit for the excel function, but u forgot to edit the value count which is still 'aws' count so you said 'surprisingly data are the same.' :D . Needless to say , your whole video is Great. :D\n",

      "6418 Amazing video Ken! I was messaging you on LinkedIn other day!\n",
      "6419 Man there was so much to learn from this video. Really loved the part about Ray following up on the question he missed, never thought about it this way. Also, recently I've been reading some books about habit building too (Atomic Habits by James Clear currenty), trying to focus on habits and being consistent with my practice of data science. I believe that the 66 days of data science will be a great initiative.\n",

      "6429 Hey thats me \n",
      "6430 Great Video Ken, Thanks , in my other Channel ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bY5_YVQHrto&t=37s) I have reviewed DataCamp and DataQuest courses ( in Arabic and in English) and I agree with him , DataQuest content is much better than DataCamp.\n",
      "6431 This video has so much great advice for anyone seeking to break into the data science field. Great content as always, Ken!\n",
      "6432 I hope your Rubik's analogy isn't *too* accurate. I never solved more than one side of that damn thing in the 80s and gave up. I hope that doesn't mean I'm lacking the perseverance/chops for data science \n",
      "6433 Perfect, easy, short and explanatory.\n",
      "6434 Though it's late night (1:52 AM ) but spending time watching this was worth enough.\n",
      "6435 I realize that if your background is in math or statistics you learn the programming part fairly easy since there are many packages etc but on the other hand if your background is CS/software, learning math/stats take more time to catch up with.\n",
      "6436 If anyone can afford only one platform, which one to choose; DataCamp, DataQuest, 365DataScience? Please provide your suggestions.\n",
      "6437 Thank you for the tips Ken! I especially agree with the \"starting small\" part. In the past, I used to just consume most of my daily time to that new habit during the initial phase. I would just see starting small as being \"not good enough\". However, I realized that this was causing me to have burnouts frequently. So even though changing your \"bad habits\" is hard, I am trying to apply this advice and I can already see its benefits.\n",
      "6438 I have also been learning on Dataquest and about to finish the Data Analyst path. This gives me hope. Let's keep learning and pushing.\n",
      "6439 People are not able to start their careers in this field. Companies are not ready to invest their time on new incoming talents instead they want the ones with the excellent skills set and experience in the field. While almost all the tech companies have their own Data Science departments, the others which do not have one, need a person with a lot of experience in this to start one. What is your opinion on this Sir, Correct me and suggest me ?\n",
      "6440 Cool, that's a good plan #60DaysDataInsight\n",
      "6441 Yooo!! I think remember reading this guys comment here! Congrats Ray!\n",
      "6442 Learning from other code examples is definitely very helpful in my opinion as well. Sometimes you just need to see a hands-on example of a function being used and it just clicks. Knowing someone on the inside surely is helpful and that my network is something I want to put in more effort into as well. Thanks for the review! Very interesting to see the perspective of someone who also follows this channel.\n",

      "6465 Thank you very much Ken for the review, I'm definitely going to apply all the corrections and strongly consider all your suggestions! Thank you very much Man! I really appreciate it.\n",
      "6466 Hello there :) I haven't watched the full video yet, but there's a reason for this and is linked to a suggestion I'd like to propose to you for similar videos in the future: Despite being very VERY green in this, I decided to have a first go at this all by myself ... and boy was and is it still frustrating :P The reason behind this was that I wanted to try a first attempt without a guiding hand. Once I finished my first model, I quickly realized that there were tons of ways where I blundered like a total noob ... which is actually totally fine :) And despite the frustration of the experience, it felt like I gathered valuable experience from this. And it is only now that I am starting to watch this video .. but only bit by bit, as I want to try to do as much by myself as possible (mistake be damned since they are being done at home where it won't hurt anyone and where I can learn safely from the experience). SO my suggestion is this: Could it be possible for future similar videos to have it in several parts? Or, at the very least, to timestamp the different section of your handling of a particular problem? I feel like it could be very valuable, especially for very recent newcomers like me. Anyways, thanks a ton for your videos, very much appreciated ! (especially some of the code where you use apply and lambda functions to handle data transformations, this is definitely something that will be useful for me in the near and long future! :) Signed: A total newbie at this.\n",
      "6467 Hey Ken can you tell me how can I collect such types of interesting data ( likely as the whatsapp one ) , from instagram or Spotify. :) Thanks alot.\n",
      "6468 Hello Ken Jee, Could you please share the template of your resume . I am graduating this year and it would help me a lot .\n",
      "6469 Really well done!\n",

      "6472 Another awesome video, Ken! Learned a lot on how to tell better stories with data. By the way, your new GitHub profile README is looking good as well :)\n",
      "6473 I see that most of data scientist job requirements to have at least msc or phd in computer science or machine learning Is that true please need answer\n",
      "6474 Makes me think you need a good note-taking program that you are comfortable referencing.\n",
      "6475 This was such a fascinating video to watch. I think this is my favorite in the series so far and one that i'll be definitely coming back to and making some detailed notes on. Thanks for sharing the wealth of your knowledge :)\n",
      "6476 Comment :)\n",
      "6477 What's your opinion on putting class projects on github along side one or two of my own projcets? I am now a sophomore and have only started to do my own projects completely on my own. I want to start applying to interships, but feel that only one or two projects of my own is two little.\n",
      "6478 Nice review! Nailing the fundamentals is definitely the most important thing when it comes to portfolios (or projects in general). I also love how Francis used DS to analyze an actual situation of his life, I will definitely put that on my idea list! Also gj on updating your GitHub-Readme! ;)\n",

      "6484 Oh no, now I'm going to get video recommendations on how to beat the algorithm...\n",
      "6485 What constitutes the end of the video? I know some Youtubers put their ads/sponsorships at the end of the video but if someone doesnt watch that last part of the video because of the ads is that the end of the video? I know the ending screens can take up the last 10 seconds of the video so is it one minute till the end of the video or 10 seconds to the end of the video.\n",
      "6486 Hey Ken! Loved the video as always. I'm still in college and I am aspiring to be a data scientist later on. I just had a question that considering my current academic condition (year 2) is it all good if I use the code of other users (giving them proper credit of course) for my projects which I intend to present for securing an internship later on? As always, truly appreciate your videos. Keep up the good work of helping us!\n",
      "6487 I apply the concept of exciting accountability in my life, it involves making yourself accountable by telling people/the internet that youre embarking in a project, hopefully with a timeline, this pushes me to keep through. I did this by telling my friends and family I was learning how to code and that I was starting a YT channel and it has worked so far. I love learning skills so I will definitely check your Ultralearning video!\n",

My program is one year post graduation diploma in Health Analytics in canada.should i change my decision? Can i do this? Can you please guide me\n",
      "6493 Hi Ken. Really it was a great video on the data cleaning process. as a data science beginner i was really finding the data cleaning part extremely irritating when it tried it on some of the beginner projects that you have recommended. but after watching this video it would certainly help me a lot to practice more on data cleaning process.\n",
      "6494 I gotta be honest here, started learning Data Science on my own but every now and then I become lazy AF and I just stop for a period of 2-3 weeks. It's difficult to be consistently committed to the program and learning. Although I hope I slowly complete the training.\n",
      "6495 This is a compelling content. I have been watching a lot of videos that say it is just about the algorithm. Yours is different.\n",
      "6496 You are giving reply everyone ...good jo bro\n",
      "6497 Is there a way to to confuse the algorithm to shuffle random videos instead of the learnt pattern?\n",
      "6498 Thank you so much for this. Very helpful\n",
      "6499 You're literally describing what exactly I am doing to be a data scientist. Many thanks for confirming it.\n",

      "6503 Hi Ken I just finish my Python Course and i'm also confused where to start about my DS Career i have learned Some libraries too but i'm still confused and i can't figure out how to maximize how to start without wasting my time\n",
      "6504 Two questions (as I haven't installed Anaconda yet) : 1) Isn't there an Anaconda manager that allows to create and switch to different environments? I mean, you used code lines in cmd but if I'm not wrong that should be done by just clicking some commands in Ananconda navigator. Am I wrong? 2)Tensorflow is a pain for my python version (3.7). Which python version/environment do you suggest for installing and using Tensorflow successfully? Thanks\n",

      "6508 funny that the YouTube algorithm recommended me this video\n",
      "6509 Great video man! I am curious to hear your definition of 'maximising reach' as it was one of the key takeaways but was seemingly brushed over?\n",
      "6510 Hi Ken, I am taking online course on data scientist currently, with a institute known as Simplilearn. Not yet complete the whole course, but I am having preliminary exposure on data science using Python and R. Thinking to apply a data science internship to accumulate my working experience. Do you think it is a good time to apply for internship?\n",
      "6511 Funnily enough, I literally found this video on my recommendations from the algorithm you just explained XD. In all seriousness, this is great content as always\n",
      "6512 Thank you very much for video Ken!!! I'm a Data Scientist, and I was really curious about how the YouTube algorithm works.\n",

      "6518 Great video Ken. Do you happen to know if when you use a multi-word keyword like \"Data Science Tutorial\" will it be part of the search result for the term \"tutorial\" or do you have to have a separate keyword for \"tutorial\" by itself also.\n",

But I also feel like school does not provide as much practical experience or project-based learning as internships do. However, getting an DS internship as someone who has only been in university for only two years is very difficult as well. They don't think you have the skills or enough practice (which is kinda true). Just a big vicious cycle.\n",

Let's say I did a project without knowing someone else on the net did something similar to my projects, is it plagiarism ? 2. And if I get ideas from some others projects but codes are not copied at all ? Is it plagiarism ? Or what if I got inspiration from a project but did something completely different from what that project is ? Should I even cite the resources I got the inspiration even though the project is different ?\n",

This is my first try in Kaggle too, after spending this much time i wonder how much time it will take for even tougher Data , i also checked the House Rent Competition. It have 81 Features. how can we do such a detailed analysis on all the features. Not sure how the real-world ML problems are solved where they might have 100 or even more features. I am really excited to know more :)\n",

      "6652 Hi Ken Jee, thank you so much for sharing your experience on data science. I'm a statistics student and I am interested in data science. I learned some R and C++ programming language in my uni but I'm not that good in programming. Upon graduating, I hesitate on whether to start working or further study in master program. If further study in master program, what course do you suggest? Data science, computer science or any other relevant course? Looking forward to get your valued opinions. Thank you. ^^\n",
      "6653 Great clarification Ken. Not only for Data Scientists but also for other professions. In the world we're living today plagiarism is easy to do and I believe that most people do it without realising so clarifying this is important \n",
      "6654 Thank you very much Ken. Very valuable lesson!\n",
      "6655 Dear Ken, am sorry to hear about this. The saddest thing is that those who indulge to plagiarism do not understand that this practice tends to damage themselves, and you rightly highlight this aspect. If we want to strive for excellence, then we must unveil the logic and try hard on our own. Plagiarism does give one the opportunity to feel knowledgeable for one day, but in the long term it will likely show how miserable one is. The question is, how might we seek out whether we have been plagiarized? The topic of plagiarism concerns youtube too. Do you want evidence? Just look around and see how many times people post videos using copyrighted material. Soccer is one of the many examples. Or TV/radio programs. People merely do NOTHING and try to get visibility - and even money - using other's effort. I recently had a quarrel with another guy who said, \"You can wipe your axx with the Ethics. In youtube world this makes no sense.\" Welcome to the 21th century guys.\n",

      "6657 I would like to make a road map of my data science journey. How do I learn more about the field of data science and associated disciplines?\n",
      "6658 Glad you made me clear about this issue. While learning from notebooks in Kaggle and other sites I feel so low to use someones codes. But I see this is common and a quite learning approach. The thing that I shouldn't do is just not publish it as my own . Thank you for clearing up my thoughts.\n",
      "6659 Sir I have a bid confusion in field.of data science so please can you provide me your mail ID? FOR THAT in will be grateful to you\n",
      "6660 How did you find out that he copied ?\n",
      "6661 awesome video!!\n",
      "6662 Hello all and Mr. Ken Jee, It is very humble of Mr. Ken to just have a light eye the person who copied his work. I am a learning individual myself. I do visit kaggle and github but to just get an idea of how the person has solved the problem and then i take almost one to two weeks to come up with my own unique solution. Solving takes time. Learn from elders and create something on your own. Again Mr. Ken is being very much liberal here. But you will face a big issue when you go for Masters or research jobs. You will get caught and it won't look good. One other thing that Mr. Ken did not address of course he doesn't want to scare the young ones is that a company hold power to blacklist you after being caught of fraud. This means that you won't be able to apply for that company for upto 3 years or forever depending on the policy and also the company can suggest your blacklisted profiles to partner organizations and you will be totally **screwed**. Shadow learning is something very important to learn. Shadows learning suggests learning the first principles from others works . This means learning the thought process and not copying the core work. Most of the researchers have 2 ways of reaching a new success. One is making something better or creating something new. Shadow learning is something Einstein has done it himself. He worked as a clerk in a patent office for years going through the research papers or maxwell's , newtons , etc. Did he copy ? Absoluetly not. When he found out that he was a bit lagging in the math section of E=MC^2 he contacted maxwell for his expertise on the derivations. That's how we have Einsein-Maxwells Equation. See. Einstein himself wasn't shy of giving credit to the fellow scientists. Why should kids like us be shy of mentioning a partner or co worker or the sources name or the persons name ? Have an open mind like newton. Let the apple fall and create something new. Cheers and All the best . People are good but people who share credits are great. Peace!\n",
      "6663 I finished IBM's Data Science specialisation course on coursera few weeks ago. The capstone project is peer-graded. I can assure you that there were plenty of students who simply copied and uploaded others' work. It was utterly disgusting.\n",
      "6664 My goal is to build an app that uses data science to help others achieve their goals!\n",
      "6665 Thanks a lot for bringing up a serious topic! Plagiarism can easily happen when coding and you pointed out very important stuff. Hopefully people have a better understanding of plagiarism now!\n",
      "6666 Love how you always get straight to the point! So sorry to hear that this happened to you. Would you even write the source if you got some code from Stack Overflow? I probably should start doing that huh...\n",

      "6670 With Siraj the real nail in the coffin was how badly he plagiarized that deep learning paper by replacing mathematical words with nonsense words (complicated hilbert spaces, haha). I understand why people lie when there's little chance of getting caught. I don't understand when people do it in a situation where they will almost certainly be caught.\n",
      "6671 Bravo \n",
      "6672 Love the dramatic beginning hahaha already know it's going down It's great you took such an ambiguous topic and broke it down with rights and wrongs. Really important to highlight the consequences too. Great video!\n",
      "6673 Thanks for clearing that up Ken thats sucks man. It really is important even when following your guides here on YouTube that you get the credit you deserve!\n",
      "6674 Hey Ken, I'm very new to programming. I followed along with your Glassdoor Project (reproducing it for the UK). I attempted every section myself before looking at the approach you took for each step of the DS pipeline. But when I was stuck (As this was my first end to end DS project - this happened a lot) I referred back to what you did. Here is a link to my repository: https://github.com/TobiAdeniyi/glassdoor_proj Is the referencing Okay?? The results in the table are in question marks because it takes ~1 hour to run all the models.\n",

      "6676 Time\n",
      "6677 This is a pretty insightful topics in terms of originality regarding projects. Now in terms of the \"finding the same dataset someone used and using different algorithms to do some analysis\", wouldn't that also kind of include people using common datasets from Kaggle in that case since it's the biggest source for data science projects?\n",
      "6678 I think some of this comes from being badly informed on proper protocols for giving credit (just because something is freely available on Github doesn't mean it's free for anybody to just grab as their own with no strings attached), and poor mechanisms for dealing with the understandably great pressure some face in the field. Doesn't make it right, though I agree with you that I doubt it typically comes from ill intentions. On an unrelated note.... I think it's \"sy-kit learn\", not \"sick it learn\". \"Sick it learn\" sounds like a modern experimental metal band or something ;)\n",
      "6679 I have a question in regards to your work being original and you having the ability to do it yourself and that being important to employers. So with the web scraper example, would you say that an employer would say that you maybe don't know how to do that? Would they rather you go through and write it out fully yourself, which would've substantially increased the length of that project. And of course, you knew it well enough to modify it. And I will be clear, I am not saying that you should copy it without giving any credit. But if you did what you did, would an employer say you don' t understand. I hope that made sense... Thanks, I appreciate your channel!\n",
      "6680 If I did want to site your work from your data science project from scratch video, what exact steps would I have to take? Like what is the format for citing work?\n",
      "6681 Hello, I am from Iran. Could you please guid me to learn a programming language to find a job In Canada?\n",
      "6682 Hello sir, I regularly go through your videos on data science. As you said you follow some precoded template (coding) for most of the projects. Rather than the GitHub code. Could you please share some of your advanced codes for Data science projects (python). Thank You\n",
      "6683 I had no idea you get more credit having shared that you are using non-original sources. Super counter intuitive at first but makes sense\n",
      "6684 Ken- great example of how handling a problem maturely brings you a net benefit. Lets assume you freaked out, put this guy on blast and moved on. Youd feel worse, and I (VERY green data scientist trying to learn the ropes) wouldnt have learned this valuable lesson! Your ability to calmly walk through the pros and cons helped out a lot of beginners and Im sure you feel better having taken mature action.\n",
      "6685 Would be great if you went through a project showing how to site work etc ... later down the road showing best practices.\n",
      "6686 Thank you so much for the video! I followed along. Unfortunately I got the result for Salary all the same values. I am from the USA. I checked Inspect section, made sure that it's still \"gray salary\". Any ideas how I can fix it?\n",
      "6687 Very good information! I agree with you that reading others code is the best way to learn! I just uploaded a case study demo of data analytics.\n",
      "6688 While I think it is an important conversation I should point out that most of what you described is not plagiarism. It is more intellectual property violations. I think technologists have become so accustomed to software reuse that the lines have been blurred. I agree with the principal of your commentary just pointing out the legal distinction in hopes of focusing the discussion into the appropriate arena of IP and open source licencing. Thank you for your content I do enjoy watching it.\n",
      "6689 So if I used someone elses algorithm with totally different datasets, I should cite the person on my project right?\n",
      "6690 Finally somebody called it out. Thanks\n",
      "6691 You mean you got sirajed \n",
      "6692 Great topic and good video. I think you set the appropriate tone overall. I believe most people learn by copying/following along/mimicry (whatever it is called) at first. I know that I have reproduced projects for the sake of learning. Now when I follow along with someone's project I find it REALLY helpful to state where it came from on top. This way I know where it came from and can return to the original material later if need be. My personal thinking is that many, many, many (did I say 'many' enough) people forget the internet is open, to a fault.\n",
      "6693 This is a very important topic, I agree! As you have said, using someone else's code is very common in DS or just tech in general, however it is important to credit the people correctly. Some people may think \"I could have written that code myself\", which can of course be true in some situations, but I like to think that using code is at least somewhat comparable to quoting in literature. If you use a normal sentence such as \"the weather was nice\" obviously you don't need to quote anyone. But if you want to use a longer paragraph of text (or code, in that matter) it is very important to show the source. Now in literature this is made pretty easy by placing quotation marks and just referencing the author but because code stays below the surface in many areas plagiarism can go unnoticed for far longer, even though it is not less important to credit people in tech than it is in literature. Thank you for making this video and bringing a bit of light onto this topic, I think this is something which should be made very clear! Edit: When writing I just noticed that it makes a lot of sense for one's self to give proper credit as well. As you said it makes people happy to see their code being used well. So if you give proper credit you not only make yourself feel good, because you did the right thing, but also the creator, because their work was used and they got credit. On the other hand, if you don't credit, you feel bad for plagiarizing and the other person becomes angry because of it. So giving proper credit is basically a win-win!\n",
      "6694 Thanks for watching everyone! To clear things up, the work of mine was copied in an article that was published on a blogging website that you can make money off of. If someone simply has this in their repo, that is not as big of an issue, but it should be cited there if they are applying for jobs. Plagiarism is a serious issue in data science. Hopefully this could help clear things up!\n",

      "6700 Very annoying background music. Also in podcast. Otherwise perfect.\n",
      "6701 Thank you for this informative video Sir, this is truly helpful to young inexperienced present and soon to become data scientists such as myself. As far as plagiarism goes with respect to code I have a question. I'm sure that even on the internet there are some niche, common and popular data sets which are considered to be the kind of must do's for new data scientists. In such a scenario its probable that 2 entirely different unrelated and isolated data scientists decide to use the exact same methodology to analyze the data, in such scenarios how should one go about giving the due credit to the people who have already employed similar if not the same method for analysis? Additionally on a completely unrelated note I have a school level (class 11th and 12th, high school) coding competition coming up comprising of 2 rounds. The first one being questions related to coding and java, python and c++ and the 2nd round being solving 3 real world problems using code under the span of 1 hour. The second round is purely python coding based. I only know vanilla python well (most of the general functions and methods) and have no experience with either java or c++. I was thinking of learning some modules I've briefly learned the foundations of throughout high school such as numpy, math, csv and either pyqt5 or tkinter. Do you have any tips for me that could help me win this competition? Its my first coding competition and I want to test myself against other coders from other schools and most of all see if my efforts have borne fruit. Any tips or other modules I should revise or learn would be extremely helpful. Finally I have one last question, I've researched this quite a bit on both YouTube and the internet through articles but I haven't found any satisfactory answer to a question. What's it like to be a Data Scientist, I'm not asking the work schedule or when a DS wakes up what he/she does at the start of the day and then what they do at work and after returning home what work do they do related to DS. I want to know what is a data science life in general, what do you do on off days, how much \"me\" time do you get, what kind of holidays do you get to connect with friends and families and just take it easy and take a break from work. I'm eager to know the \"life\" side of work life balance with regards to being a data scientist. Sorry if the comment is a bit too long, its just that for me you are the only working professional and mentor figure I can ask these kinds of questions. I'll be really glad if you respond. And again, thank you for making these videos, they are a huge help.\n",
      "6702 It's nt a issue until and unless they are using ur codes in learning channels and earning money. Becoz ultimately even if they get DS/DA jobs by showing your codes they will definitely struggle to carry out data scientist role and threw out of organization \n",

After watching him gently placing the side panel down on the floor to remove the film it shattered again lol.

I am familiar with Excel, R, and statistical packages like EViews & SPSS, but I was rejected from many Data Analyst internships in the US. So for now I started an internship in Morocco, where I basically make a questionnaire for a certain sampe, collect data, and analyse results. I have been also learning Python and Tableau because they were mentioned in the requirements of most Data analyst internships. Do you think I can land an internship next spring in the US with my anticipated level. Also how was the evolution of Data Analyst jobs and internships impacted by Covid 19.

      "6781 Thank you for making this informative video Sir! You stated that inculcation of an additional discipline along with Data Science provides a boost to your resume, however for students who are aspiring to be data scientists and will shortly join college, how will they be able to get the added benefit of having experience in another discipline. If I restrict my argument to myself, I will be pursuing either a DS or a CS under graduate degree, how can I compete against individuals who have the added edge of another discipline. Another question I have is could you do a full tutorial style video on how one goes about making their profiles on platforms such as LinkedIn, GitHub or Stack Overflow (And which platform carries the most weight in recruiters' eyes), as an adolescent I feel daunted by the thought of making a good profile as not only am I inexperienced but I'm also unaware of the do's and dont's. Videos such as these project reviews are extremely useful for more experienced watchers but a video targeted towards the newcomers would be a boon. PS: If you can please tell what name you decided on for your new PC Once again thank you for making these videos, I cannot stress enough how helpful they are!\n",

Do you think it is good for a project to mention how did I got the data but no which websites I used? My goal is a recommendation system with aggregated data, of course free. But I am afraid that some of the websites may not like this idea. How am I supposed to scrape if many websites restringe their use? I would like to know what do you think Thanks!\n",

      "6834 Youtube suggested your channel and I had to watch. It was last week. Then I returned in order to find a video on \"Where\" to start learning. But, what you talked about was \"How to learn\". I mean, the advices were \"No matter what courses you watch, just make sure to do in a way that you feel that works for you. Look into Kaggle and learn from built projects\" and such. However what I couldn't find is exactly where to start on languages. Please, please, don't get me wrong I'm just trying to understand where to focus the inicial focus to learn this science. What I was looking for was something more fundamental, like \"Start learning Progamming Logics, then you should tackle the basics of a programming language like R or Python, then you should learn about DB with...\" I don't even know if it is necessary to learn about database to be on Data Science lol. Again, don't get me wrong. In reality I'm asking you: What are the fundamentals to start to learn this awesome job? I see the enthusiasm about this topic on your videos and for a long time I had this will to learn, however I'm not a programmer myself, in any language at all. Could you please, help me to find the initial step? Thank you for your videos, they made me like Data Science even more, even when I don't understand almost nothing about this world. Wish you success and waiting to see more videos. If not about my request, well, Data Science is already enough for me to follow the channel.\n",

I was wondering, with those variables in mind, are we able to dig a little deeper and see what the actual values were that contributed most to the model? If that sounds confusing, here is an example. Age is the second most significant variable in the model. If we can program what I just asked you, the model would \"spit\" out ages 15-18 years, I do not know if that's true, old were the most significant and contributed most to the model.

First of all thank you for making them, its extremely difficult to find any person on youtube or otherwise that provides such comprehensive guides, it really helps aspiring data scientists like me a lot! Secondly I'd like to ask you whether I should aim for a CS undergraduate degree or a DS one, I've seen a plethora of videos and then I've realized that at present the CS is the go to degree, however the shift of preference from CS to DS is occurring and I'm trying to think ahead that when I graduate, would a DS degree increase my chances of getting hired or would the norm still remain CS. I'd be extremely grateful if you could provide some insight into this. As for the name of your new beast of a machine, I'd suggest the name Kronos from Greek mythology, the Titan of Time (I'm a fan of Percy Jackson and other works of Rick Riordan). Kronos would probably be the perfect name because - 1. You said at the start your build was made around your gpu, the rtx TITAN, so for the computer to share a name with an actual Titan from mythology would be pretty cool 2. Seeing the specs I'm sure this machine will be crazy fast and that'll result in much faster response times and code compilation times, seeing that time is such an essential aspect here it makes the name Kronos even more fitting since he was the Titan of Time 3. The age of the Titans is called the Golden Age in greek mythology, seeing that your graphics card is also golden, i think it makes perfect sense Once again thank you making these videos, they really are a huge help! PS: I hope you like my name and the reasoning I gave\n",

      "7161 So much applicable useful information in this video, thanks again Ken!\n",
      "7162 I just graduated with my Bachelors and always thought data science was interesting and that it was the path I was going to aim towards. But recently with the low amount of entry level DS positions available and the overwhelming amount of material to know, I have been debating on changing career paths. I definitely underestimated the level of knowledge and expertise you need in order to be in this field. Watching this video has helped me realize that maybe it isn't the right fit for me. I am personally uncomfortable with autonomy mainly because I haven't had any prior work experience. I definitely have a lot to consider. Thank you for sharing :)\n",
      "7163 Hi Ken, i have done a bunch of courses online and from some DS bootcamp, how do i gain experience with the knowledge i possess in readiness for a job interview?\n",
      "7164 Is that an oura ring? Thank you Ken for the honest helpful information, I am starting my journey into data science and this was very helpful!\n",

      "7167 Eric is great! Love his LinkedIn posts! Great video Ken.\n",
      "7168 Thanks Ken for this amazing podcast, really enjoyed the discussion. I totally agreed on sharing data science work socially. As a researcher, sharing my data science work on has opened several doors of opportunities. For one, people who see the work that I share socially may reach out to me with opportunities to apply for research grants, to take part in awesome collaborative research projects, to take part in editorial roles in research journals, prospective students reach out to join our research group, serve as the starting point for collaborative discussions, to serve as external examiners of PhD dissertation, etc. As a YouTuber, I learn a lot from the subscribers (questions, suggestions, feedbacks, tips and tricks, etc.), collaborate and engage in discussions with other awesome YouTubers such as Ken Jee, Krish Naik, Dhaval Patel, Jay Feng, Jaemin Lee, etc. Aside from this, the act of sharing is like paying it forward. Imagine if we all share, the collective intelligence of all the awesome ideas and works would serve as amazing resource to learn, get inspired and create further awesome data science work. \n",
      "7169 Hi Ken, at 12:00, when checking the multiple linear regression summary, for variables that has either very small coef (slope is close to zero) or p values smaller than 0.05 (statistically not significant), can we `safely` remove them from the regression model?\n",
      "7170 2 legends and both do BJJ\n",
      "7171 Sir, I have a confusion I want to ask which is better an online certification course on data science or a 3 year degree program?\n",
      "7172 How much time it takes to become an industry ready data scientist?\n",

      "7176 Do you think I can get a job in data analytics from commerce background without a traditional studying approach, i.e, a degree?\n",
      "7177 Love this! As a pragmatist I find it appalling how intimidating this field appears before you start diving in and getting your hands dirty. Hopefully people can start to understand that DS is human intuition applying math and computing as a tool but not a concept separate from real word problem solving.\n",
      "7178 I recently read something about digital footprints (don't remember where but there's a brazilian video that talks about it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb8yXWFRROg&t=479s). It talked about how anything you do or post online, maybe a github account, or a comment on stackoverflow, anything that can help the world see you, is efficient, the important thing is to do somehting. Sooner or later, opportunities will come. Great video Ken. A suggestion: I think it would be nice to talk about foreigners trying to enter the data science market (in your case in the U.S.). How it's possible, advices, maybe stereotypes or if there is much prejudice . Think it's a nice subject.\n",
      "7179 What sarkar pls come again????\n",
      "7180 Great content like always. \n",
      "7181 David Perell wrote about the concept of 'serendipity vehicle' in one of his blog posts where he explains the importance of sharing your work on the internet. It goes hand-in-hand with what you explained. Great video!\n",
      "7182 This video hit really deep personally. I have been thinking for a few months now that I should show my work more. I though about starting a YouTube-channel or a blog, because I think it would be a lot of fun doing so. Especially when Eric said that everyone has a personal brand, and your choice is not if you want one or not, but if you want to actively take part in shaping your brand or not, this really made me reconsider the way I think about showing my work. I now feel even more motivated to start sharing my work more. Thank you for this video!\n",
      "7183 Thanks for the informative video! I just wanted to know whether octave platform is useful or jupyter notebooks are much effective for data science/ML\n",
      "7184 Thanks for watching everyone! You can learn more about Eric on his linkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/in/eric-weber-060397b7/\n",
      "7185 All videos that talk about Data Science are basically: git gud.\n",
      "7186 Sharing your work -> opens up more opportunities\n",
      "7187 Thanks ken never used Kaggle or even done any data science projects. The detailed analysis (including the nuances MOST IMPORTANTLY) is really making this digestible not to mention applicable\n",
      "7188 Hello Ken! It's amazing how your channel has been growing. I'm looking forward to expand my DS knowledge. Are there any books/text books you would recommend for learning Data Science? Thanks!\n",
      "7189 Can you please tell,from where should i study mathematics for data science?\n",
      "7190 Thank you sir for this great content \n",
      "7191 Hey Ken, Currently I'm learning Data Science, but soon I want to learn Deep Learning and Machine Learning too, Which one should I go to first. And what should be the areas I should cover in those, I'm totally unaware of these topics. Thank You. Great content! :))\n",
      "7192 Can you do a video for soccer?\n",
      "7193 Hi Ken, This year i will go to college and i'm between a Data Science degree and Computer Science degree. I want to pursue a career in Data Science. I already now some languages of programming (mainly Python, JS, C and a bit of R) but i'm afraid that the programming aspect that the Data Science degree has will not be sufficient for the future and also i'm afraid that the Computer Science degree will not give the necessary skills for a data science career such as analysis, statistics etc I'd like to know if you think that a Data Science degree is worth it or if a Computer Science is better. Thank you and i love your content keep it up.\n",
      "7194 Amazing video! I hope you do a similar video on regression and clustering problems in the future!\n",
      "7195 Hi Ken I would love if you review my resume, I just sent you one in email.\n",

      "7205 Hey, I am a new fork I just want to know what can be considered as a good score for this problem? I scored 0.75837 And I see thousands of people with score of perfect 1 So just confused Please help me with you thoughts\n",
      "7206 Hey Ken, great video as usual. I wanted to let you know that I got the job in downtown Chicago at a finance company but I have some questions. I start in 2 weeks and in that time I want to do some finance projects but kaggle doesnt have that many, I was wondering if you could recommend some finance projects/datasets that I could practice on. Thank you!\n",
      "7207 Hey ken, I have been watching your videos for at least 1 hour a day the past week and I love the content. Im 19 and am beginning my journey towards my career in data science/sports analytics and your content has by far been the best Ive come across. I was wondering if there was an email that I could contact you with? Or would you prefer Lengthy YouTube comments instead? Either way, thanks again for the free content its very appreciated.\n",
      "7208 This is great walkthrough for beginner like me. Thanks Ken Jee\n",
      "7209 This series really is giving me such a confident boost with the provided tips that I'm learning!\n",
      "7210 Heyyy ken jee, You, data professor, krish naik and codebasics are doing an excellent work and helping many data aspirants from the world to get their life settle. Thank you for all of this.\n",
      "7211 That's good information. Thank you so much!\n",
      "7212 Thanks Ken, once I have finished learning the fundamentals (midway through online course and Kaggle courses), will get these done, your videos are very helpful!\n",
      "7213 I prefer using both,sometimes its just exiciting if you have tools that Can close the disadvantages of another tools.I used R for analyzing data and it's easy to do many statistical testing than python, in my opinion,but remember you also need to know SQL and hadoop for this data science\n",
      "7214 Hi Ken, great video. Thank you! Please consider making a similar video with panel data!\n",
      "7215 Thank You\n",
      "7216 Short and sweet!!! Thank u.\n",
      "7217 I clicked the like button right before you mentioned it! I found this video at the perfect time. I'm at that stage where I realize how much I don't know and feeling overwhelmed and that I'll never be able to recall all of the information I've been learning. It's great to know that I'm on the right track and doing the same thing with how I am organizing my notes. New mantra: It's not shameful that I can't remember everything.\n",

      "7219 Hi Ken, I am a Mechanical Engineer for seven years. I dont have a lot of experience in programming or data science. I am looking at taking Bootcamp for Data Sciences at USC, but it is an offer by Trilogy. I got into the program within two days of applying. I try to do research for the validity of the certificate, and statistic of the students who would get a job in data science after the programs. I dont find a lot of information. I am wondering if my best bet is to go to a Master's Degree in Data Sciences?\n",
      "7220 Any intro stats online courses for total beginners?\n",
      "7221 I think the point you make around 6:30 is a really good one in general for all forms of science and engineering. It's really about practice at the end of the day. We're not born math geniuses, we learn math through repetition and problem-solving. Same thing applies to data science and programming. The more you practice it, the better you get and little by little the overwhelming problems seem a little less... overwhelming :)\n",
      "7222 What's the exact difference between a Machine Learning Engineering vs Data Scientist?\n",
      "7223 Long time no comment (exam period came quick :D) ! Awesome review(s)! I just took some time to catch up on your uploads and I noticed, that your recording, your background and your thumbnails have upgraded! It was also really great seeing you collaborate with other people in the community. One question I always had about your channel is why you had this golf-wallpaper as your channel banner. But after watching the previous videos I learned why, which was cool to know :D\n",
      "7224 Video just shows you don't need to have great hair to be a data scientist! Thanks for watching everyone! Comment below if you would like me review your project, portfolio, or resume. Please also send an email to kenjee.ds@gmail.com\n",

      "7227 Hi Ken, I have to predict a binary classification, the dataset has two columns with monetary information, both have right-skewed distribution. If i scale columns and /or apply log transformations, accuracy gets worse. Why could that be ? Even by removing outliers (percentile 98 or 99) it also gets worse, Thanks !\n",
      "7228 Sir I want you to also review data science internship Resumes too\n",
      "7229 I'm doing a virsual internship that data professor mentioned, in which section should I put it my resume?\n",

      "7240 Hi Ken, thanks for the help on learning about data science. I struggle a lot using Kaggle to learn python. The user experience for me is quite intimidating compared to other platforms I used as there are times even when I know the question, I get lost on how to answer and follow the steps.\n",
      "7241 Thank you for the great video! It's very helpful! ^_^\n",
      "7242 This may seem like a silly question, but how much should I expect to retain in my calculus and statistics knowledge gained from math classes once I am actually working in the field? Should it be expected that I could whip open any calculus textbook and solve a any math problem without having to look at notes? I only ask this because when looking at advanced calculus videos on YouTube, it makes me wonder how I will ever be able to retain all what I've learned, especially when I begin learning differential equations, exterior derivatives, pull-backs, and other advanced topics which as of now seem like a foreign language to me.\n",
      "7243 Hi Ken, your videos are really helpful for beginners like me. Can you do a similar walk-through video for House Prices problem as well.... thanks in advance.\n",

      "7248 Amazing analogy! I'll definitely borrow this when I need to explain what data science is\n",
      "7249 Looking forward to more videos like this . It's incredibly helpful to get an experienced viewpoint on how to think about and dissect these sorts of problems.\n",
      "7250 You have saved us hours of self-exploration! Thank you, Ken :D Hope you can make more videos like this!\n",
      "7251 First went through a couple of minutes of the video where you discussed what had to be done and started solving it by my own. Once I was done, came back here to check out how you'd solved. This was immensely helpful as my code was not as efficient, and learnt better approaches to the same problem! Thanks Ken!\n",
      "7252 I followed this video of yours and started with course from both Kaggle and Google along with a blog. Thanks for the advice. https://machinelearning464260418.wordpress.com/blog/ Do suggest anything else that I can improve or work over.\n",

      "7260 Hello Ken Jee, I have Bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering and I'm currently working as an engineer for piping company. I am also doing master's degree (online) in IT. I'm eventually trying to get into Data Science. Is getting AWS Certified Data Analytics - Specialty certification good enough to land a Data Science job considering I have a master's degree in IT?\n",
      "7261 This is incredible. Thanks\n",
      "7262 Thanks. Really appreciate the breakdown. Looking into exploring into DS, and this has been the best breakdown of the pro and cons if each option. Thanks Ken.\n",
      "7263 Id be super interested in seeing you competing in a real Kaggle Competition.\n",
      "7264 thanks for the advice, i`ll start learning python right now. the quality of the video would be 3xbetter (at least for me) if you look right to the camera when speaking. idk maybe im weird but i feel it makes a big difference. thanks again :)\n",
      "7265 Interesting. I was wondering how representative this approach is. Querying '#CaptailMarvel' would only pull up a portion of the overall Twitter conversation on the movie, as most casual users don't use hashtags in that way. You're likely looking at a sample of mostly media tweets. Doesn't devalue the analysis of course, great work!\n",
      "7266 I really enjoy both interviews! I remember back then in the end of 2018 when I decided to study ML by my own during my master in physics. Daniel's channel got my motivated, inspired and informed about the online courses out there. Today I work as a Data Scientist in an amazing company that produce plant-based foods trying to imitate animal products using artificial intelligence. I recently found your channel Ken, and it have very honest advices and great material to people that want to start in Data Science and also people in the industry already! Thanks to both of you guys!!! PD: Can you share the podcast with Elon Musk? :)\n",

Planned to take a Master's degree in Data Science but have to forego because there's no scholarship available due to this horrid pandemic. Just started a free data science online course on Kaggle. My question is, am I on the right path? Is it really possible for me to become a data analyst through this path? Hope you can share your insight. I'm so desperate tbh because I just lost my job recently due to this horrible pandemic \n",

      "7281 I went to indeed and started researching the local job market, Nashville, for data scientists. Every job required a MS in data science. I immediately can to YouTube and found your video. My intent was to take Harvard's online DS certificate program due to its low cost. Base on what you said in this video I am just going to scrap the idea of becoming a data scientist. You confirmed what I found in my job research on indeed. I am a mechanical engineer and I also have a degree physics. I assumed that this would be a seamless transition. I currently make 6 figures in my current role. I am not looking to take a hit in salary for an super entry level job as a data scientist if I can even land this role due to the requirements employers are looking for.

      "7300 Thanks Ken! I'm working on the same competition and that was super helpful! Quick Q - I'm trying to build up my DS portfolio, do you think it's worth my time to do the whole thing from scratch (i.e. EDA, feature engineering, modelling) and to dwell a bit more on the theoretical stuff? Put another way, is it more important in these types of projects to show knowledge of how these models actually work, or to show that you can use tools and libraries (like sklearn) proficiently?\n",

      "7334 Learning how to learn and breakdown information was one of the best skills I obtained from my academic experience. Oddly, learning data science has been more rewarding thus far, mostly because of being self-reliant on myself and becoming independent. Not having a syllabus and everything planned/laid out in front of you is a skill in itself. It is great to be able to obtain the skills regardless of background as long as you put the work in. This means a lot to me as someone who was a first-gen student, and college isn't always attainable or even the right path. Now to advocate for internet accessibility across the U.S. and also the globe. Thank you both for the informative interview. I will be journaling my progress at the end of the day... we all could use some confidence and motivation.\n",

Im currently working a research internship in medical physics, and Im using python with numpy, pandas, etc. to analyze how the accuracy of CT scanners changes from week to week. Even though this internship hasnt had me use any physics so far, Ive found the analysis very interesting. I would really like to get a job in data science without going to graduate school. What would you recommend that I do in the next year while I finish up college to best prepare me to land a job? I go to Texas A&M, so we have a huge network, but I dont know where to start (other than using the kaggle courses). Ive tried looking at job postings and it seems like all the jobs require a masters degree and/or 4+ years of experience. Thank you!\n",

I've ended up completing my Bachelors in Sport and Exercise Science and am currently the middle of my research project in Biomechanics. Although I enjoy the field I feel like my contributions if I stick with it will be limited to academia and find the idea that my articles may rarely ever be looked at quite disheartening.

I graduated with management degree and cal 1 is the highest math class i had. Is it possible for me to self taught all those math. If yes, what are the resouces you would recommend me to learn from. I wish i study more math back in college but going back to college is not realistic for me now. Thanks again for your time and your sharing in video.\n",

      "7437 Superb dude!!Thank you\n",
      "7438 Your videos are so informative! You brought up a lot of good points and it was nice to see Dos as well as Don'ts. I haven't watched many of your videos yet, but I am interested in your thoughts about how one gains \"domain knowledge\" as I have noticed it is not discussed often in online materials (but it is often mentioned in my MS data science program). If you already have a video about this, I will make sure to search further! When I started my program, I was sure I wanted to work in marketing research (I have a BBA), but now I'm distracted by all of the shiny new concepts I can learn in school. Now, I'm considering a second master's and not sure if I should do computer science, software engineering or marketing research. Decisions, decisions, but 5 AM probably isn't the best time to be making life decisions.... \n",

      "7440 Man, all these just remind me myself, I tackled bunch of majors even filmmaking, then end up doing Economics. Now in my 25, I became data science freak. It's sad how those years were unproductive but I think everybody has a unique career and that brings us unique opportunities.\n",
      "7441 Given that I do not work full time current, do you think it would be feasible for me to spend 6-5 hours a day (in 1.5-2hr blocks) learning various Data Science building blocks / projects. I did spend most of my time studying/sitting in lectures back in university, however, not having done that recently may feel a little overwhelming if I do decide to spend that much time on learning again.

      "7445 Greetings Ken Jee. Thanks for the clear and concise explanation. No doubt, with the current global climate given the pandemic, this area of study is going to pick up tremendously. Great to have someone guide us in the right direction. Hope you and family are keeping well during this difficult period.\n",

      "7447  !\n",
      "7448 Hey Ken, How do you go about classifying data as unknown aka outside the distribution that the training classes fall into? My neural net softmax probs are high for data that should be unknown\n",
      "7449 Hi Ken-Jee....\n",
      "7450 I've got a Ryzen 7 computer with 32G RAM and NVIDIA 2080 Ti, since I'm going to almost exclusively work with neural networks. My professor has 128G RAM and claims that isn't enough for the real-life tasks :) I don't really like Colab for the serious work. First, the session expires pretty quickly, and you should fall to the shameless tricks to keep it. Second, transferring gigabytes of data for training via Internet may nullify all the advantages of TPUs. Colab is great for the small learning or experimental projects, but it can't train a BERT-based network that required more than a day on my 2080 Ti.\n",

      "7452 Ken Jee, tell me please! SSD on SATA 3.0 for what kind of work in data science we can use? And for SSD on NVMe the same question) hope you understand what do i mean) Thanks a lot for your videos, interesting to listening to you!\n",
      "7453 Thanks, Ken, for this! You're simply amazing!\n",
      "7454 Hi Ken, I've been following your work quite some time now. The way you keep your online presence is inspirational. I would love it if you have more step-by-step project videos on Youtube. There are so many areas in which I don't even know if analytics are applied. Sport analytics is interesting for me for example. Also, projects with more practical implications like the regular churn model or HR analytics would add value to your channel, too. I would enjoy watching them on my end at least.\n",
      "7455 Hey Ken I am currently pursuing my ms in DS but want to continue my studies further will phd be a wise option if I want to work in industry and not planning to go into academia? Or will MBA be a good option since DS needs some buisness knowledge?\n",

      "7461 Ken, Thanks for another quality video! This is a golden piece of advice on the million dollar question. The 3 tier starter specs are really useful starting point for building our own PC. Currently most of my work are down on my MacBook and run on the cloud. Will definitely, re-watch this video when I actually go and build my own PC.\n",
      "7462 Nice guidance Video. Video quality is increased so greatly.\n",
      "7463 Sir, I request you to interview Joma Tech\n",
      "7464 A starting point for aspiring data scientists graduating from undergraduate degrees in data science is seeking out a role as a data analyst, data engineer, business analyst, or business intelligence analyst. There are significantly more openings for these roles than strictly as a data scientist. Plus build a website to showcase particular skills through a portfolio of representative projects.\n",

The impetus for the migration was my need for an ergonomic keyboard because modern notebook computer keyboards are terrible for extended typing sessions. Eventually, I will add an NFS server providing easily expandable file storage but that is likely a project for next year as part of a larger re-architecture project for my home office network and computing hardware.\n",

      "7471 Thank you so much Ken for your awesome videos\n",
      "7472 Hi Ken Jee, thanks for the great content! I decided around March that I wanted to make a career change into data science and quickly realized it was going to take a lot longer than I originally thought. Although I have a degree in aerospace engineering I have been working in sales for the past 8 years so my technical skills weren't where they needed to be. Anyways, after doing some research I came to the conclusion that starting out in a data analyst role might be a more attainable path for me because of my lack of experience and that form there I could transition into data science once I have real world experience. My question for you is, do you believe entering the industry as a data analyst is a good way to do it? Also, do you have any tips for writing a good resume when you don't have experience? I have been taking online courses in SQL and Python and feel pretty proficient in SQL but not so much in Python, still need to work more on that. Thanks again for the great content, I appreciate the hard work you've put into sharing your knowledge.\n",
      "7473 Hey, Ken. I'm using Asus Vivobook. What can you say about it? Thanks\n",
      "7474 Great work Ken I'm working on pursuing a Python basic concept by the end of this week.\n",
      "7475 My goal is to apply deep learning in Computational Biology and to do a big project based on that. Being a bio student this is my niche I want to work on. Hopefully, I will learn enough to get a research internship.\n",
      "7476 Considering that I am now 45 and looking to begin a masters in data science program this fall since my current masters in exercise science has not yielded any sort of suitable or gainful employment, I'd be more than content to find an entry level data analyst role upon graduation from a data science program. Although I have done a handful of projects and have started building a portfolio, I'm hopeful that my chances of getting an internship, landing an entry level data analyst role, or associate data analyst role while going through this master's will be increased. It's as if I feel starting this masters program will help give me that extra edge to at least obtain the most entry level position in data analysis versus just my current degree and portfolio. I say this because it seems most job listings require or prefer some kind of quantitative degree, and exercise science does not seem to make the cut. There seems to be too much of a question as to landing an entry level data analyst job even with a much more robust portfolio which I'm sure I could have by year's end.\n",
      "7477 I found this video to be extremely basic and vague (and the video doesn't quite match the contents: you show very expensive components and then speak how it's not really necessary to have powerful PC for beginners). The general recommendations are fine, but there is no explanation as for when and why you would want to get anything better than Ryzen 5. What tasks are particularly CPU focused, and will benefit noticeably from e.g. Ryzen 9 processor? If it can save you several hours of computing a day, it can be a big deal, but if it says less than a hour, it's mostly pointless. The same goes for graphic card. Nvidia RTX Titan seems extremely overpriced for what it does. From what I can tell, it's only slightly better than RTX 2080 Ti, and cots twice as much. Is there even any reason to get it? Maybe some additional optimization for Data Science tasks? So far it looks extremely cost ineffective, even for highest end PC. Might as well get something cheaper for now and then upgrade to RTX 3000 when it launches. Again, unless it can save several hours of computing every day, I don't see how it makes any sense at all. Additionally, I wonder how impactful RAM memory speed is for Data Science tasks. Does it make sense to overclock your RAM, or is it just a waste of time and effort? Finally, I'm not sure if it's correct to simply ignore Motherboard and PSU (You listed a 500$ PC, and then you mentioned 200$ for motherboard and other components, which practically increases the price by 50%). Again, depending on how important storage speed is, it might make sense to get a more expensive motherboard, such as B550 or X570. However, if it's not as important, and regular NVME SSD is more than good enough, then good B450 board is plenty powerful. As for storage Samsung NVME SSDs are way overpriced, so I wouldn't recommend one personally. Good ADATA NVME costs just 70-75$ for 500 GB, and is only marginally slower. My recommended budget build based in my understanding will depend on the country, but in short here doesn't seem to be any significant differences from general gaming build recommendations. For processor I'd get Ryzen 5 1600 AF if it's available for under 110$, otherwise Ryzen 5 3600 is the best choice. For memory if speed is not super important for Data Science tasks I'd recommend Crucial Ballistix Black 2x8 GB 3200 MHz. Even if it is this kit has good overclocking capabilities. Wouldn't get anything below 16 GB, as Chrome is a memory hog, and you likely need a lot of tabs open for data science projects. For motherboard I'd recommend B450 Mortar Max or Tomahawk Max, as those support upgradability. For cheaper options B450 PRO-VDH Max is also good. For SSD ADATA SX8200 Pro 500/1000 GB is the best choice (depending on your preferences regarding regularly cleaning your PC). I wouldn't get anything below 500 GB myself, since this will likely cause major inconveniences. For PSU anything 550-650W is good enough. I wouldn't get anything below Gold certification if your PC runs for 10+ hours every day. If available at reasonable price, Deepcool DQ-650M is a good choice. Monitor doesn't really matter for Data Science, so anything cheap and sturdy will do. Graphic card is a tricky one. I'd probably try to look for a good used option for a budget build, but it's hard to find a reliable seller. I assume Nvidia cards are easier to use for Data Science, as AMD cars get less support. Used GTX 1060 6GB is a bare minimum I'd recommend, but if you can afford a more expensive one, 2070 Super looks like an optimal choice in terms of cost to performance. Personally I'd get 1060, and then upgrade to RTX 3070 when available. As for the case, anything above 60$ should be fine. Got myself new MSI MAG case, it's quite, runs pretty old and comes with fans already pre-installed. More premium options are Phantex P400A, and Meshify C. Secondary components like motherboard, PSU and case may seem unimportant, but they ultimately affect performance, reliability, upgradability and longevity of the system as we. Still would like to know how important memory speed is for Data science tasks. 16 GB 2400 MHz and 16 GB 3800 MHz are 2 completely different kits for some tasks.\n",

      "7484 Have you considered doing a video discussing the different operating systems? Lots of conflicting opinions between Windows, Mac, and Linux and very few resources for data science specifically. Would be great to hear your opinion on this matter\n",
      "7485 Can you show us how to get/use GPU resources from online such as Amazon service or Google platform? I tried, but felt a little hard\n",
      "7486 Hey Ken, how're you? Great video once again :) Apart from MacBook and Dell XPS what are the other laptop suggestions you have?\n",
      "7487 The video I've been waiting for! I'ma save some money and go for the mid tier one as I wanna get back into gaming!\n",

Actually I have interest in Data Science and i have just gotten admission for my Msc in Data Analytics but i do not have any basic knowledge in Machine language, programming and all the necessary things needed to make the course easier for me, and i am really interested in this course, please, what do i do to meet up with the standard of the course and also to finally achieve my purpose in choosing this course?\n",
      "7492 Great video! Always informative.\n",
      "7493 AMD Ryzen series is awesome, I just rebuilt with that and an AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT. Absolutely awesome.\n",
      "7494 Thanks for making this video Man ...!! I have never own a Laptop or system before it's more helpful to understand the requirements of a system....! Actually I'm also planning to buy a Laptop for learning DS big thumbs up to u man.....! But the problem is there is no such laptops under the price range of 500 $ with the specs u would mention in the video could u pls suggest some if u don't bother abt the mentioning......!\n",
      "7495 Hi Ken, I was wondering the level of math you need for DS, Im getting mixed results in my research. I was a biology major in undergrad and the highest math I ever had to take was calculus I (basically just doing derivatives), and this was a long time ago so I dont remember how to do it anymore. I was exploring data science masters back in my school and others, and theyre open to non STEM majors, and the most math they require was statistics. Do you need to know differential equations, linear algebra, and more advanced calculus? Or statistics and the various statistical tests covered in statistics will be fine?\n",
      "7496 For beginners, go with what you have. Of course it is nice to have high specs, but to get started you dont need that much power. You can do pretty much anything on kaggle, googlw colab, or native jupyter notebook. If you get professional enough, you will need what kind of computer you need. For much of data cleaning and learning and linear regression, average computer is just fine. You dont need nvidia cuda cores for that. Waste of money for beginning.\n",
      "7497 Nice content Ken \n",
      "7498 Great video, I have a gaming pc build that I use but yours if one of the first Ive seen on DS PCs\n",
      "7499 Hi Ken, Could you do a video (or videos) on machine learning on the cloud? I see GCP, Azure and AWS have a lot of services that help you setup your ML environment on the cloud. I believe this is going to be the future where creating a ML pipeline using cloud services is going to be crucial considering that the data usually exists on the cloud and training on the cloud is cheaper that racking up physical resources.\n",
      "7500 Another question is that, in my data, the multiple linear regression performs fairly well with the training data (use cross validation) but really bad on test data, is that caused by over-fitting? For Lasso and Random Forest, it's fine\n",
      "7501 Hi Ken, thank you for the tutorial, I have followed along from the beginning until here, I must admit that the most fun and useful part is to watching you got stuck by something and went through debugging. I have a question for dealing with missing data, in this example you consider \"-1\" for most categorical variables as a \"new\" category (by using dummies that's what it is in my understanding), wouldn't it better to replace them with other forms or try to predict them using available values? It'd be great if you can share some insights on that. Thanks so much, please keep it up.\n",
      "7502 Thanks Ken for this informations.\n",
      "7503 that slow transition into tech review for data science ;) I see you Ken\n",
      "7504 I have only been looking at DS for two years but I built my first PC at 11 in 1994 and I did it professional for a while, so I know I have built and setup at least 5000 computers. I would choose a Mac with parallels, without a doubt. Then you can use OSX, Windows and Linux. I wont go into specs, since I do a lot of 3D modelling in Inventor I know I set the limit quite high.\n",

      "7510 I have a business role in Operations / Planning, but all my major accomplishments were related to collecting, treating and analyzing data in Excel and Power BI. I am currently learning Python, R and statistics to do it more professionally, and in the future I would like to be able to do predictions/ML to bring even more value to the business. I fear that strict data roles may get me too far from the business routine, what could be a problem as I do enjoy living in the supply chain area. I am not sure if being a Data Scientist is my ultimate goal, but I also don't know which roles would be more aligned to my objectives. How do you think Data Analyst/Data Science roles would blend with more business roles?\n",
      "7511 i posted this comment below an other video in data science. i saw that both you and this guy are interested in data science, so i woud like to listen also your tips. I have a question about data science filed: do you think that a bachelor degree in statistic is more useful than a computer science degree for go into this field? in my country statistic is a sub field of social scinece and there are only few course of computer science,just databases,fundametal programming and statiscal sw. A computer scientist has more skills in programming,they study for example more sw exams (sw enginners,operation system ) but less statistic,probability ecc. I read that company prefer more computer scientist beacause they dont nedd statistician that are expert in hard modelling,math ecc but they usually \"suck\" in it field,like programming ecc. but they need only basic knowledge of statistic and a lot of It skills. So wht do you think, is a good investimetn a bachelor in statisitic or is better a computer science degree? there are a lot of master degree in data science from both accademical course, a lot of people with a bachelour in computer science go in to statistic and viceversa. i would like to have your opinion about this tips. thanks. regard from italy :)\n",

      "7517 I'm trying to decide if this field is for me. I use Sales Force at work and occasionally have to pull raw data from it. I use rudimentary search words or phrases to try to isolate cases our front line agents log from their customer contacts. Often, however, there are limits to the results I get and almost always the data I get is so poorly captured that it inevitably means I have to manually read hundreds of thousands of records individually to see if there are trends. The categorization of the data is a separate challenge of its own. We have folks who created a system that does this automatically, however, it's still high level information the way the issues get bucketed. It's also about 2-3 days behind so trying to get data real time is another limit. I'm new to this, so I envision being to run raw data up to hour and be able to paint the picture of what's driving call volume, trends, for example, that we may need to act on immediately and then having technology/automation do the grunt work to classify the data and give me actionable information to present to my team and leadership. But as I see it, there's the obstacle of getting good data from the agents as the major issue in its own. Is this even possible? Has anyone else run into this? I was planning to take an IBM data science course on EdX. It's good to know about Kaggle. I'll check them out. Thanks for this presentation, good stuff.\n",

Any idea what kind of math I should brush up on to prepare? The program itself hasn't even started, UT Austin is still putting it together and planning on accepting applications in the next few months. I was hoping to just get a little ahead of the curve.\n",

And then I had to change my major to something related, so I chose IT management in the end because I was interested in management and MBA as well since before. But even now I still feel like compared to data science, my major doesn't seem to be that professional. So I was thinking of teaching myself some mathematics and then studying data analytics with using either R or python through free online courses. Do you think a self-taught grad student who majored in IT management would be okay to get a job as a data engineer in 2 years?\n",
      "7528 What are the pre-requisite for these projects i.e python, R, Sql or a person who has completely no background of coding can do it??? Please do reply!!!\n",
      "7529 Ken great content as always! Could you list all the skills that fang would expect from a person to have ?\n",
      "7530 Sir, I want to ask you how many years will data science rule in the number 1 demand for IT profession job\n",
      "7531 Ken sir, I want you to add as many projects and courses in your videos as you can\n",
      "7532 Hey ken what would u say about self taught data scientists? Can they never become good data scientist like others? Are data scientist roles in companies can only be play by degree holders? What will employers think about that data scientist?\n",
      "7533 Ken sir i want you to mention courses as much as you can in your videos because that will be alot helpful to us and thank you for this amazing video i really learned alot from this video\n",
      "7534 I see a crazy hype for Data Science roles/jobs in India, is it the same abroad like in US,EU,Australia,Zealand and Canada?\n",
      "7535 This video could not have been timed better. I am literally meeting with my counselor next Monday to discuss switching from CS to a undergraduate DS class. Thank you!!\n",
      "7536 the more i look at you the more you look like David Schwimmer from his Friends days lmao\n",
      "7537 What is the difference between taking an online MS data science program vs. an on-campus MS data science program?\n",
      "7538 Ken Jee &Import data \n",
      "7539 I am dual major is CS (specialising in DS), and commerce (specialising in econometrics). I am wondering if econometrics would cover enough stats for the DS field? Love the video!\n",
      "7540  !\n",
      "7541 If someone chooses an undergraduate degree in data science, in my opinion, they should take first and second year courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science as electives if their data science degree lacks courses in those subjects. I am currently enrolled in an undergraduate data science degree after taking over 60 credit hours in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. This advice by Jaemin is spot on and your own videos are very useful.\n",
      "7542 Cool video , but why three clocks?\n",
      "7543 Thanks a lot!! can you please share some recommended books for data science learning.\n",
      "7544 Hi Ken, at 58:46, the error is caused by using `avg_salary` to pivot table against `avg_salary`, it can be solved by replacing the code: for i in df_pivots.columns: with for i in df_pivots.columns[:-1]:\n",
      "7545 Right before the pandemic I switched over to Data Science from Agriculture. I am currently studying Computational & Data Science B.S. with a Minor in SE. Then I will go for a Software Engineering M.S. The undergrad degree is more modeling based... they teach R & Fortran. I am learning Python on my own, this fall I will be starting a 2-part Python certificate, 1 part intermediate 2 part advanced. I hope this is the right track? I want to learn SQL additionally.\n",
      "7546 I am an undergraduate in Computer Science & Engineering. Could you have a look at these Master's Programme and suggest me which is more relevant to the current industry requirements? Note : I have offers for all 3 programmes mentioned 1 . QMUL - https://www.qmul.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/coursefinder/courses/big-data-science-msc/#course-study (Modules excluded for my intake (ECS789P - Semi-Structured Data and Advanced Data Modelling ECS7001P - Neural Networks and NLP) ) 2. Glasgow - https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/taught/datascience/#tab=structure 3. Surrey - https://www.surrey.ac.uk/postgraduate/data-science-msc-2020#modules-sn Huge Thank You to both of you!!! <3\n",

      "7549 Thank you for making these excellent series, very well structured!\n",
      "7550 Hi Ken! Thanks for this amazing video! Can I ask you where you did your resume? I mean which program or web site you can recommend and why? I know you mentioned MS Word, but it very poor on design.\n",
      "7551 Thanks !!\n",
      "7552 One thing I would add in here, I've just had a look through his code and one criticism I would have would be around his use of Oversampling. He does this before he splits his data into the test and train set which causes data leakage (Not as much as a naive upsampling method but since nearest neighbours is being used, some leakage is happening meaning it's generalisability beyond this dataset may be limited) - just thought that would be helpful for anyone using oversampling methods.\n",
      "7553 Hey Ken, super insightful video! I understand you should always show results in your work experiences, but how would you do that for data analytics/BI experiences e.g. designed dashboards, built charts, prepared reports, cleaned up data, ran ad-hoc data analysis, etc. I have listed SQL (BigQuery) and working git,python and tableau knowledge in my skills section, currently facing problems in quantifying achievements, thanks in advance!\n",
      "7554 I am currently interning as a Software Release Engineer and will be moving to a Machine Learning role in December, is it okay if I do the ML from December to August and then Statistical Consulting at another place from August to December and then go back to ML?\n",
      "7555 Im trying learn data science 7-8 months\n",
      "7556 Hi Bro, I am already with 10 years of experienced in IT CRM technology. I wanted to move in to Datascience. I am already working in a data science company on crm. Is it a good option to move into datascience after 10 years of exp? Does company expect more if i join as a experienced person. Actually i am getting a good salary but still i am just working on a tool which has just limited growth.\n",
      "7557 how to get one row of this data, for example just to access a PTS or AST or REB column!?\n",
      "7558 Thank you for the tip, I knew about titanic dataset but wasan't aware of the others in kaggle (exept in courses where they used it) Is it overkill to solve one of those with deep learning or do you recommend the basics of supervised ML?\n",
      "7559 Tired of python python but no internship yet.\n",
      "7560 Hi Im student of Actuarial Science in Mexico. My major has a lot of subjects related to Data Science (statistics, maths and code), but Im really interested in have more knowledge on Data Science. I have seen a course in EDEX from Harvard about Data Science. Apart from all the good advice you gave us, will you think is a good idea to join this course? Thanks \n",
      "7561 Im currently doing a masters in ds with a heavy stats component. I transferred from the same course at a different institution that had one stats unit. Do you think this is a good move for my career?\n",
      "7562 Tough call but I'd say CS or SE not particularly data science it's better to choose after you know most of the stuff that a computer student would know which you will learn in BS CS or SE, then go for a specialized field\n",
      "7563 Hi Ken, i have strong fundamentals on programming, and I can easily learn math , but i dont know anything related to neither business things nor economics topics... is this mandatory to become a data scientist? And if so, do you know where can i learn it?\n",
      "7564 I've had several recruiters reach out from the FANG companies recently. I'm stunned that they keep telling me that I need to relocate to the Bay Area even after announcing that their workers will stay at home through 2020 at the least. Where is the disconnect?\n",
      "7565 Ken - you've made a great niche that fills a big need. Thanks for your support of the emerging data science community.\n",
      "7566 It would also be nice to here what y'all think about a Masters program in Data Science vs something more traditional like CS or Stats. (especially curious about degrees labelled \"Masters in Professional Studies\". like are employers put off by that vs an MS?)\n",
      "7567 Hey Ken would you recommend DePaul's MS in DS or MS in CS? I know you did CS just wondering your thoughts.\n",
      "7568 Really informative, our students recommended it\n",
      "7569 Hey Ken Jee, thanks for the video it was really helpful and highly motivated. Currently i am self employed and thinking about a career transitions towards data science and i am new to coding but i have a Bachelor degree in mathematics. I really have a passion for it so finally i thought why not give it a go. Will you please let me guide towords it step by step. what certificate do i need for a good resume or is self study is sufficient. Please help!\n",
      "7570 What resource for statistics do you recommend to get started\n",
      "7571 I am currently in medical school but I want to learn data science so that I can use that knowledge in my research projects.Having so much work to do from the college side its becomes difficult to decide how much I want to learn and in what time. Can you give some tips?\n",
      "7572 hey man, i know basic/intermediate programming in R/Pyhton so that i can introduce algorithms from libraries- like lm() in R-Studio. Right now i think the next best step would be to improve my programming skills since i study econometrics/statistics for the theoretical basis. What would be the best way to do that? It would also be interesting to know if you as a full Data Scientist use libraries or if you just program the algorithms for yourself. Thanks in advance for an answer :)\n",
      "7573 Love this shit\n",
      "7574 Thank you for an opportunity to speak to your viewers, Ken! Hope this can help many students who want to pursue their careers in data science!\n",
      "7575 Hey Ken thanks for another informative video. What do you think of the following Coursera specialization called mathematics for data science? https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-for-data-science#courses\n",

      "7579 Hi Ken! Thank you for this video, I just used your code and built my own little model! Using 2020 data and looking back at the NBA games from back in March I would've correctly picked 9 of the 13 NBA over/unders correctly. This is a small sample size, but I believe the model I have is pretty accurate. However, I was wondering how I would make it more accurate? Like what new data points I should add to predict the score. I'm very excited about the return of the NBA.\n",
      "7580 It will be great if you use slides\n",
      "7581 Thank you, that's great video!\n",

      "7585 Really awesome ken! Every video of yours is exceptionally informative,however there's one question that,how much of data structures and algorithms i should know as compared to a software engineer when interviewing at bigwigs. I know about various things to know as a data scientist/ml but how does it differentiate you from a software engineer,a little more insight on what these \"coding\" requirements are is needed. Thanks in advance!\n",
      "7586 Thank you so much for this video!\n",
      "7587 Hello! I have a masters in molecular biology and i am interesting in getting into the field of data science not to completely switch career but to help me get more opportunities with analyzing big data in biology.

All the best from Austria.\n",
      "7596 Hey, Love your content but it seems a little country specific, I am guessing USA. I just had some doubts, Is it necessary to have a degree like you have in computer science ? What if our college professors do not have adequate knowledge and reach regarding this field ? We have Calculus in our class 11th and 12th and i have no problems grasping maths concept, although i am not acquainted with physics at all. I was planning to learn Python, Excel and Statistics. Now that you have mentioned Calculus as well, i would be revising that too. I just wanted to know if i am taking the right steps ? I am 17 so i have not joined any University yet, but have been taking courses on the above mentioned topics\n",

      "7598 Great video. As a woman, I experience pushback even from family members for just being interested in science, let alone math & data. I just decided after a year that THIS is what I want to do.... switching from Agriculture. I told a family member who does something slightly similar to Data Science... and he literally asked me if I am sure it is what I want to do because it is a lot of numbers. I am excited about switching majors and going for this\n",

I have a question though, I followed almost exactly how you revised the codes, the only difference is probably that I am using data from both Canada and USA, and the \"salary estimate\" column shows all identical values (e.g. CA$89K-CA$100K (Glassdoor Est.)) but all the other columns (e.g. rating, company name) are just fine. This is so confusing to me since the codes formats for reading \"estimate salary\" and \"rating\" are the same. Any insights you can share why this occurs? Thank you so much.\n",
      "7663 Really like the advice you give us here, especially the kaggle part! I have been using those trick of reading someone kernel/notebook but it does get overwhelming, so knowing that it's hard for everyone really put me at ease. By the way, would you mind if I email you just to get a piece of advice from you regarding my study path?\n",
      "7664 This is the best DS channel on YT \n",
      "7665 Hello Ken, very refreshing videos! I have obtained Master degree in Telecommunications and am working as a network engineer. I have realized that I miss programming so much since I was very good at it and math in high school. I had some programming on college (C, MATLAB, some very basic Python), but since then stopped programming because my job doesn't require it. I like data science, artificial intelligence and Python, so I enrolled in PhD program in IoT where I've got some subjects such are Neural networks and Artificial intelligence in telecommunications. Please, do you have any advice on how to manage my time since I am doing a job with shifts, have to study and make projects for PhD and need to learn Python, statistics and similar topics in order to make career change and become data scientist? I would much appreciate if you give me concrete examples/materials what to study and pace for passing them. Cheers!\n",
      "7666 Amazing! Just one thing I want to improve: how can I set the text align to the left instead of the center?\n",
      "7667 What a Irony sir I always gets the solution of my problems every time from your videos at perfect time. \n",
      "7668 Your video on LSTMs inspired me. Built the same thing with a CNN. Looking forward to learning more on Kaggle now!\n",
      "7669 Hey man, really enjoyed your video :).Would like to ask a few things. I've started a data science course on udemy and I would like to know if there's any platform that you know of that would help me practise the concepts I've learned. Let's say I just finished regression, and I want to practice some problems on regression, where should I go. Also, would it be possible for you to make a Kaggle tutorial that would help us familiarise ourselves with the website? Like I tried to get on Kaggle and found myself lost and everything looked very high profile and I didn't know where to start as a beginner\n",
      "7670 What do you mean by documentation? You were abit vague there. Could you elebarote on that? THANKS\n",
      "7671 Hi Ken.... Please do live project or end to end project like you did with data scientist salary prediction\n",
      "7672  , !\n",
      "7673 Hi Ken! I have a doubt regarding the projects. It's like what stream should I pick up, should I experiment it first, what suits me where I should be moving, or else is there any particular domain to start with, for career options.\n",
      "7674 The videos you prepare are so on point and informative. It is not vague. The correct amount of informative touch with a pinch of reality. Hope it gets more amd more better from here. The only video that didnot satisfy me was with jay, it may be the rich content he has in his youtube channel already, you just stopped the questions with few..anyway enjoying the growth..thanks.\n",
      "7675 Love the B-Roll scenes! Huge fan of doing projects to learn. Applying the concepts I learned into projects has helped things stick better for me!\n",
      "7676 I found your channel just after I started learning Data Science about a couple of months ago, and you've been really helpful and encouraging man.\n",
      "7677 Keep growing the channel, Ken. 100k is just around the corner! And I wholeheartedly agree with your tip of reviewing other people's code. My number one tip is to go through GitHub and search by keyword for projects that interest you. From there, you can find people's scripts and run them chunk by chunk. This way you're learning from people that have a good coding foundation. This is one of the methods I used to learn R.\n",
      "7678 that was awesome thank for the content\n",
      "7679 Hi Ken! Im a 15 year old in highschool and I just finished a course on Data a science on Udemy. I have attempted a few projects on Kaggle and theyve worked out pretty well. Do you have any advice on how I can progress further and some goals I can work towards?\n",
      "7680 Thanks for another great video, Ken! The video editing and transitions are awesome! I certainly agree that one of the misconception of learning data science is limiting one's learning to a particular resource, as you said, nothing is stopping us from learning from another resource. Because the thing is, different resources may bring slightly different angle or coverage of the same topics and thus helps us to gain a more thorough breadth and depth of those topics. Really like the \"rinse and repeat\" part, learning data science is indeed a never-ending iteration loop.\n",
      "7681 Informative tips! Cannot stress the importance of learning how to read documents!\n",
      "7682 Another super helpful video. Thanks Ken! Do you mind sharing a link to your Kaggle profile? I'd love to explore some more of your work.\n",
      "7683 Thanks a lot Ken! Awesome content as always...\n",

I was able to add featured images to sections of my portfolio, but when I tried using {{< figure src=\"/images/resume.jpg\" title=resume\"\" >}} to add pictures of certifications and my resume, the images are not showing up. They only worked initially when I was hosting locally, but now, it doesn't work both locally and after hosting on github. I am temporarily using dropbox links to show them, but I'd appreciate if you could give suggestions on how to make it work. Thank you again!\n",

And I have seen in some of the videos that you are having some lists (Notes) on your walls. If you don't mind can you please make a video or share details on it, please. Thank you!!\n",
      "7711 Thank you Ken for such a wonderful tutorial, it was easy to follow and simple for a beginner to keep up with. I have been scraping Data Science jobs in Canada and they are less than 1000. My num_jobs variable is 1000. So, what is happening is when the scraper reached the last page on glassdoor it is going in a loop and collecting data from the same 5 jobs over and over, I guess it will do that till the length of jobs dictionary reached 1000. What can I do to make it stop once there are no new jobs?\n",
      "7712 Do you even get a certificate from Google Machine Learning?\n",
      "7713 Seeing what people have done on Kaggle can help, but better than Kaggle projects is to make your own projects which will require that you obtain data on your own or from someone else. It's more effective for the learning process when you have a connection to the stakeholders.\n",

One of the things I did in college to stay focused & productive was to have a solid wall between the studying/productive time and my leisure time. For instance, I would be productive from 9am-1pm and reward myself by doing something fun (playing games, playing with my dog, etc.) for about an hour! Then I would get back to the productive time from 2pm-7pm and reward myself again!\n",

I have some questions for you and I thank you in advance for your answers. - with my statistician background, do you think I can be good enough to have a job in datascience? - I have completed datascience 365 bootcamp and I want to know ways to apply all the knowledge I got there. - how can I find a distance job in any company or enterprise, because in my home country it is quiet difficult since we don't have enterprises really needing it. Thanks a lot and I don't know if I can get your mail for further discussions. Thanks\n",
      "7813 This discussion is definitely going to be valuable to people who are looking into FANG companies!\n",
      "7814 Thanks Ken for another quality video! Great insights on the FANG interview process, Jay!\n",
      "7815 Thank you!! There aren't that many data science youtubers so this is really helpful :)\n",
      "7816 Hi, i started learning python during the lockdown but I really don't know how to figure out what i want to do with my life going forward after university? Any advice please?\n",
      "7817 Great video \n",
      "7818 Thank you so much sir for posting this interview i really wanted this\n",
      "7819 Amazing work brother. A similar video on the skillsets required to get a job as a machine learning engineer in FANG companies would be great. Continue the good work brother.\n",
      "7820 This was super fun! Thanks again for the interview Ken!\n",

      "7828 This was so helpful. My background is in biology and cognitive science/psychology and throughout undergrad I've been using Python and R to run a variety of different analyses for hypotheses, research questions and data insights. Most of these don't have a ML component, I'm learning that now. could these projects still be relevant for landing a data science internship?\n",
      "7829 Thanks for the advice (subscribed right away :D). Can you help explain how do you choose the right method (SVM, Random Forest, etc) to be implemented in a model for any dataset? Does it depend on the complexity of the data?\n",
      "7830 FyI I think the idea of kaggle itself has grown pointless when teams with big compute capacity and pretty much educational institutions have thrown the completion out of skew..\n",
      "7831 I found the wind + your voice + content a great combination actually lol thanks for the info!\n",
      "7832 Ken thanks so much for these videos. I was able to land an internship for an online retailer, and look forward to getting some great experience! I am hoping to turn it into a longer internship with them 6 mo - 1yr as I graduate with a master's in DS in august of next year. Do you think this is a good plan for transitioning to one semi-related field into data science? Again thanks so much for the videos!\n",
      "7833 Another awesome video. Thanks Ken. By the way, I'm really curious on how if during master/Phd degree, we also have a job as DS in company. Please make this video to negotiate yourself, company and college, it will helpful for me and other \n",
      "7834 hey ken! i hope you are fine. stay home, stay safe. i would like to give suggestions to make videos on 1)-data visualiztion 2)- real time projects of data science 3)- contest going on kaggle and teach how to solve them. 4)- just do not stop making these wonderful videos on data science, it is very helpful for newbie in data science. All the best!!\n",

I haven't read it yet by myself (but I want to do it soon), but in the other yt video I've heard that author's research are quite questionable, like lower cancer rate when you sleep less than 8h (something like this). I think this makes sense, because just like diet, everybody's need of sleep is different and it should be more personalized aswell. Nobody should force himself to sleep more if his body doesn't need it. Your channel is great anyway, keep up with the solid work!\n",

Maybe I will try Kaggle soon. I have already started some very simple data sets from Kaggle just to practice to use matplotlib. I am good at Math but I have not tried any algorithm class, what would you recommend if I stay with Python? Also what are some good kaggle datasets you would recommend to practice with machine learning or data visualization skills?\n",

Its about values from 0 to 3 : no degree/years of experience : 0, Bachelor : 1, Master : 2 and PhD : 3. Everything seem to work well until now. I made the linear regression model using sklearn and the result of the cross validation is extremely high beside the result i should have ([0:3]).

      "7987 Fist of all, thank you for your time making this series. It casted a lot of light to me on the big scheme of things in a project (how you handle it as a whole) Most resources deal just with certain parts so they miss the big picture. I'm having a hard time... I'm trying to get ready a data set (cleaning, inputing, binning, etc)... i wrote individual functions that take the full dataframe as input and outputs it with the respective transformation/inputation/... Resources mention that is good practice to write functions... So i did... Then i stumble across custom transformers, now I'm trying to create one to use it rather than the individual functions What is the difference between using lambda funcitons( like in here) and creating the custom transfomers? Is it good to write one transformer that will deal with all the steps (cleaning, custom value inputing, changing types of values, discretizing, aggregating categories, etc, etc) to get my dataset ready? Or what am i supposed to do? Then i would like to use it in a pipeline to finish with encoding and scaling... I'm kinda lost and can't find any good resource to solve this... Thank so much you and keep the good work!\n",

      "7992 Nice video! I'm not familiar with your channel but saw the thumbnail/its length and clicked through - a few other ideas/resources to choose from that I think can be really helpful for beginners depending on how they like to learn: --------------- 1. Make a habit of partitioning off a small portion of your learning time to do some light reading on best practices - this is softer information and can often be more subjective than the harder skills, but it can be extremely helpful in adding context to why certain things are the way they are and potentially help save you some cleanup down the road (things like docstrings, virtual environments, project directory structure, etc). (Like everything else) this can be overwhelming and my advice would also be to choose one thing at a time and start trying to build it into your workflow - docstrings and virtual environments are both good examples of things that take a little getting used to but can feel very fluid after a short period of time and save a lot of headaches with package managers (+ if you're using vscode or PyCharm the autodocstrings are great and keep your time spent doing the things the machine can't, not playing with margins) --------------- 2. Listening to podcasts about the subject (IMO) is also extremely valuable and can be done on the go - even if as a beginner you don't understand much that they're talking about, hearing others talk about common problems before you get to them can help you understand what's happening more quickly whenever you do. Additionally, a huge part of this field is learning how to articulate the problem you're trying to solve for on google/stack, and listening to podcasts can help you learn how to articulate things better both verbally and in writing. I'm much less familiar with the R podcast landscape but for Python beginners, Talk Python To Me is great for slightly deeper dives into a specific problem domain and Python Bytes is good/fun weekly exposure to the evolving packaging landscape. 2.1 Quick addition to the above point, another thing it can really help with is understanding the extent to which most problems, particularly on the data processing/cleansing/wrangling front have already been solved for - I've often seen more novice programmers try to recreate the wheel at every turn and hearing more experienced people unpack how they approach problem solving can help save you from writing a script to do something that's part of a standard library. --------------- 3. Time spent finding the right resources is never time wasted - in addition to paid courses/etc, I'd encourage finding someone on Youtube/similar who does a good job of articulating things in a way that makes sense to you. Corey Schafer has a fantastic Python channel covering everything from basics/best practices to end-to-end application development --------------- 4. Acknowledging that this would fall somewhere towards the latter half of the progression outlined in your video, I think it's super worth calling out that all the services we use personally have open APIs from which we can programmatically extract our data from and can be a great way to build out your mechanics in a fun/more personal way - it's also a natural and safer step towards web scraping since it's all the same communication protocol. Amongst many others, Spotify has a super user-friendly API and a well-supported helper library called Spotipy for anyone who might like this idea and be looking for a place to start Python beginnings to start learning how APIs work. --------------- Again great video and I hope the data dump's welcomed:)\n",

I graduated from Bachelor in Chemistry, worked in Biology research field (mainly bench work) for >3 years and intending to pursue a Masters in Biomedical Data Science. I would like to ask if learning Python and basic statistics through online courses will be sufficient for me to bridge that gap between wet-lab based research knowledge & skills and data sciences/bioinformatics? I'm unsure if this is the right place to ask about biomedical data science/bioinformatics but I am hoping to receive some advice from a data science expert so that I can better prepare for a field switch.

Time series and customer analytics are much easier to understand. The final five modules are basically implementation and are mainly ML. How should i advance? like learning more advanced ML and DL? Should i just go kaggle instead? or borrow books to enhance my skills? as i do not know how vast the world of ML and DL is. LOL. Thanks\n",

The UNHCR has datasets available publicly in the form of csv files. How can I start to work with these in a Jupyter notebook?

I have so many questions because the reading doesnt explain every line of code thoroughly.

      "8061 This was a really great analogy towards the process of learning data science. This reminds me of my data structures class from freshman year where my professor said that even though that most people will have the same type of code to solve a problem, there are many different ways to approach it. Pretty much just like how there are many different ways to learn something. I'm still on this journey as well and just like the advice given here, I use resources that make the most sense to me when I'm developing projects. I relate to the small wins thing as well whether it would be making tutorials for Data Science concepts for the organization that I'm a part of, the Bit Project, or making projects through the knowledge that I have gained through tutorials. Of course my code wouldn't be as complex as someone else's work, the important thing is that I made something that I'm proud of and that the ability to continuously learn will get you far on this journey. Thank you for the wonderful content as always and I hope that you enjoy the rest of your day \n",

      "8069 I already had a solid Math background when I started learning DS - but my graduation was 25 years ago :) I also had a LOT of programming experience, but not in Python or R. And still, my greatest problem wasn't the Math or the Python, it was *lack of the systematic approach*. When you go for one of the countless \"become a data scientist in 10 hours\" course, you don't really understand that material. The worst thing is you might THINK you understand it, but that's a false feeling. There is no way to understand it all in 10 hours, be prepared for a long journey or retreat. There are three books that I recommend to everyone: 1). Mathematics for Data Scientists (M.P.Deisenroth and others) - all math you will need in a convenient form. 2). Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Predictive Data Analysis (Johh D. Kelleher and others) - everything about Machine Learning except for the neural networks. 3). Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras and Tensorflow by Aurelien Geron - a great book about Deep Learning (you may skip the other parts). All three books have a lot of exercises, and you should do ALL of them. After that you will know enough to consider your knowledge solid. I've stopped on the exercises for the very first chapter for now, though I've read the books, of course :)\n",

      "8075 Hi Ken, as always it's a pleasure to watch your video that distinguishes you from the many yackers around talking about data science. When i was listening to you, it came into my mind Tim Ferris and i thought about \"selection\", one of the key steps to learning. In my idea, to learn data science the first step involves figuring out what are the most frequently used and important mathematical models and algorithms. Once we have this shortlist, we can select key programming languages - i personally opt for Python and R - and try to work out real-world problems with these 2 languages. How, do we do to know if we are gonna do well? One way is to pick algorithms as performed in any of the courses you proposed (or even in Kaggle, where i have been starting giving a look), implementing to the real-world problems as said above and double-checking the solution by implementing the same algorithms using secondary, high-level programming environments like Matlab or Mathematica. I know that mathematica has lot of functions that help you do what in python requires dozens of lines. Just sharing with you this crazy ideas ;-) Ciao!\n",

      "8079 Hi Ken , this video appeared right exactly when I just gave up doing my Coursera course in math for data science, as I couldn't solve function approximation task . Seems like I am too dumb and don't have enough math background to be data scientist . Science I only can code, but when it comes to advanced math related problems, I feel depressed. Did you have the same feelings or it just me ? These advanced math related problems really scare me didn't expect to face such problems where I don't even understand the task itself \n",
      "8080 Hey been watch your channel for a while, great stuff... Could we get an in-depth video on the differences between a Data Scientist and Data Engineer? It would be really helpful.\n",
      "8081 Ken, I too was all over the place and felt like I wasn't going anywhere. So, a few months ago, I refocused and decided to learn SQL/NoSQL first. Just 2 weeks away from completing 8 certificates (just to give my learning journey some context), I estimate I'll be at an advanced intermediate level. My next \"puzzle\" will be math and statistics. Wish me luck going forward.\n",
      "8082 Another great video! <3 I think the advice you give is very useful, because I've been following the same methodology when learning Data Science for the past year. I'm try to understand and practice each individual part of the whole process of building a project first and then in the end everything manages to piece together perfectly after that. I've been solving Rubik's cubes as a hobby since 2009, so I think I'm pretty good at not giving up when something gets difficult. Just as you said, it takes a lot of time and patience, but with enough motivation and hard work, you eventually reach your goal. ^-^\n",

I can only imagine how daunting it would be to jump over a huge hurdle (or to climb up a huge mountain as you mentioned) in front of people who are just starting to learn. I believe this video can guide people who are just about to learn data science in the right direction. It's important to take small steps at a time, instead of trying to do everything at once.\n",

      "8108 hey! i just started learning data science about 1 month ago. I followed your steps to learn, I've learned python basics by doing courses on udemy for python, also for matplotlib, numpy and pandas. I also learned abit of nlp because I will be doing it for my FYP. However, now after going on Kaggle and following your advice to read and understand the expert notebooks on Kaggle. I just feel so overwelmed by how much I do not know, I find myself googling almost every line. Is this feeling normal? Should I just keep going learning this way?\n",

      "8110 Hi @Ken Jee, thank you so much for your videos, it helps me a lot to navigate what I need to do to improve my portfolio. Would you mind giving me a little bit more information about this? I generally put my analysis writing on my Medium.com and code on Github. Then I connected the two together because I got those Medium.com articles that got featured on TowardsDataScience. Plus, Medium.com generally provides a much better layout for my project analysis. Do you think that approach is much better compared to just publish the analysis on Github? Looking to hearing from you soon\n",

      "8218 I think learning by doing is a wonderful, fun and efficient way to learn a range of skills. HOWEVER, after 40+ years developing for large, medium and small commercial, non-profit, military/defense and other companies across communications, strategic data, media, AI, quantum-AI, full stack and other areas, I have also seen the dangers of that as a primary, let alone singular learning approach. People who learn exclusive via doing especially working predominately on their own while eschewing theory and complementary skills prior to that approach, often have major applied theory and application context gaps in their knowledge that they appear generally unaware of. Obviously, this depends whether you are learning predominately on your own, or if you have guide(s), mentor(s) and/or teacher(s) that help point out short-comings and gaps in your knowledge base and approaches. There are multiple factors underlying this problem. First, it is very hard for most people to deeply self-introspect to see where they lie on broad based external knowledge continuums without significant sources of historical, theoretical and contextual reference. This is why the first factor of where people are on the Dunning-Kruger curve skews left with people who have largely self-educated without a broader base of external references as noted above. The second factor is the fact that most of the time, most people simply do not know what they dont know. In other words, it takes a broad base of external theoretical, historical and contextual learning to develop metacognitive skills to help us intuit where we have gaps in our knowledge base, and to consistently discern correct from incorrect conclusions. While working on our own is a great way to learn deep, practical skills, we see that it often comes along with blinders to broader alternative views and approaches. In other words, you can easily be unwittingly blind to the fact that your toolbox is mostly bare, and that you dont know how to optimally use even the tools you do have. For example, we see people who have never heard of Donald E. Knuth, JADD or Charles Petzold that have instead learned simply by doing, who code using approaches that others have long since bypassed, resulting in programming that causes problems and often must be rewritten and projects that must be taken over by other groups ideally prior to them causing real world problems in the end user community. So, while there is no substitute for hands on learning and many have succeeded in becoming gainfully employed as programmers without much classical computer programming training or academic education; even hands-on learning approaches work better in the form of a balanced apprenticeship approach, where you work autonomously, but under the direction and oversight of someone much more knowledgeable and skilled than yourself. The fact is that the number of software developers on the planet doubles every 5 years. As such, by definition this means that half of software developers have less than 5 years experience. The number goes down as you get to more specialized areas of knowledge that increasingly can have a broad based impact in unforeseen ways on the future of humanity. For example, the number of AI programmers is doubling every 12-14 months and is still falling. This means that on average, AI programmers have a year or less programming skills in AI. Increasingly, the percentage that have any significant general programming or computer science education is dropping, as the demand for AI programmers is far outstripping what our universities and training centers can provide. As such, more people are self-educating, often by jumping in and doing prior to getting any significant training. Sadly, many of us who dont get the academic knowledge and theory up front, never go back later to address that, since they get too busy and immerse in immediate needs. So, the gaps and deficiencies upon entering the workforce often are carried throughout their carrier. Often they become highly proficient programmers and such, in whatever language(s) they happen to need for the tasks at hand, but they often dont learn to intuit when, for example they should turn to something like Node.js versus Python, or use Matlab vs Tensorflow, etc, So, what is the negative result of people learning predominately hands-on rather than under the oversight of others who are significantly more knowledgeable and skilled, and preferably with a good foundation of theory and broad based learning to bolster their metacognitive, theory and analytical skills development? The result is that suboptimal approaches, zero hour bugs, and higher rates of failed projects, as defined by the failure to meet one or more primary deliverables as defined by the final SOW. Further, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more. We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches. So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhDs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people from a financial standpoint, what are the alternatives? First, online learning when done in conjunction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful high utility educational base. Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. Also, as AI is integrating to the very fabric of our digital world, we are seeing a wide range of badly trained and architected systems that are leading to avoidable deaths, flash crashes in major global markets, just in time delivery system failures and much more. We know the causes of these are often programmers who are being primarily trained autonomous hands-on approaches. So, given that traditional education in the form of BS, MS and PhDs in Computer Science and associated fields are increasingly becoming further out of reach of more and more people, what are the alternatives. First, online learning when done in conjuction with apprenticeship learning is a basis for a wonderful way to learn. Further, programmers need to step outside of their comfort zones and explore and identify areas that they are weak in. For example, say you spent a few hundred hours learning and taking on a few projects in Python and Swift. You should also read several of the seminal computer programming theory and related books at the very least in the areas you are focusing on, and preferably add to them over time once you have internalized their benefit. Statistics repeatedly show that people who never learned core theory prior to beginning a career have a much lower chance of ever learning those areas. Similarly, it can be a great boon to identify a local universities or a company that needs interns where you can work under and along side others with different skills. While the pay may be minimal or non-existent, EVERYONE (self-taught, university skilled and all other modalities of learning) should intern just as is done in other mission critical and related fields like medicine. And it is a LOT cheaper than the college alternative. In medicine it is done on top of 6-9 years of additional post-university graduation education, while in computer programming, a rapidly increasing percentage never even get any post graduation training of any significant merit let alone intern/apprenticeship training. Is professional programming any less deep or broad of an area of knowledge? Not if you want to excel in terms of being at least well rounded and far more employable than average and definitely not if you wish to excel in skills, compensation and job satisfaction. So, dont migrate primarily to hands-on without getting a good base of other approaches behind you, because statistically you probably will never go back to rectify the competency, knowledge and related gaps you create by doing so.\n",
      "8219 I work as a finance report analyst with some sql queries with visuals in Power BI but its more of a accounting role and I am trying just to focus on data analysis. I have a Masters in public administration and did publish work and did go thru statistics class. I am not sure if I should do the Boot Camp or get a second Masters Degree.Boot Camp at my University is about 11 thousand dollars even though I have the money dont want to spend it something useless that will not provide the tools I need to get into the filed. I have seen countless videos and it seems like some ppl say that its a scam but I really want to get an insight .. would you hire me as analyst if I have a boot camp and some prior experience?\n",

I am currently starting with the housing project and I didn't know how to start on my own so Im using 2 other notebooks as references and kind of copy pasting, would you consider that normal when starting or is it bad ?(I'm gonna reference links to both of them when I finish my work of course) 2. For the getting started projects in Kaggle in general and the ones you mentioned in this video when do you think I can say I succeeded with this project like what's the minimus end goal in the score or something like that ? Again thanks!\n",

I have been thinking recently that I would like to get a textbook on the probability used in statistics, such as a textbook in probability theory (and random processes), is this something you would recommend? Also, are there any \"machine learning\" or other textbooks in statistics you would recommend? Many thanks.\n",

I am planning on majoring in Data Science, and Im thinking of double majoring with a Psychology BS and maybe even a public policy minor. My goal is to work for the CIA/NSA in the future, but I also am still young and this might change. I also think working in politics as a data scientist would be very interesting and a rewarding career. This being said, I dont want to restrict myself and would like to keep my options open. Im very passionate about all three disciplines, but Data Science is my top priority. Thanks for the advice!\n",

And for the ones who is not from the field, but really passionate about data and the math behind it - and of course have enough time to do so -, won't you recommend a second bachelor related to the field? For example: Statistics, Computer Science, Mathmatics, and so on? . Briefly, I think for the tools, softwares, programming languages there are no better place to learn them than in online courses. Thus, the bachelor would give us the theory we need and in parallel sharp our skills with online courses. . I'm curious to know your opinion about it. Cheers from Brazil, buddy!\n",

I am currently doing an internship in a startup that's developing insect farms (insects for human consumption, mostly crickets). I'm majoring in Industrial Engineering, started my internship in more of a production stand point, but due to the pandemic I've redefined the project for a data driven improvement. In the last couple of months I've helped the company with its data collection and aggregation methodologies and tools. That has led me to be really interested in deepening my knowledge into data science.

      "8383 Hi Ken, i need your honest opinion man I'm confused in choosing between Data Scientist or UX Designer There are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective I am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such Visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music But what i asked is much bigger than that I know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design However, i want to know how's the life of both careers? Which one offer better work life balance? Because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours. When i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project. Then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? Because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. Third, when you become the CEO of the company. Which skill is best to master? Data science or ux design? That will absolute critical as someone in that position. Like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you\n",
      "8384 So on 31st May I searched youtube for \"Data science portfolio website\" and found this awesome video posted just 2 days before! I have made my first portfolio website thanks to you guys!! Thank you!! One heads up for anyone making their own site in this way: After uploading files some of the images might not load on the page (when run using Github pages) This happens because some images that were uploaded have the src = \"/images/..\" To get the photos simply edit the index.html file for the pages where the images are missing. Change the \"/images/..\" to \"https://dataprofessor.github.io/Ken_Portfolio/images/..\" and the images will show This was something I faced and that's how I fixed it.

I started coding for the first time, with the beginning of the pandemic in March. I enjoyed it and also I had nothing else to do in the lockdown, so I invested whole days in learning Python/Data Science; Watched a lot of tutorials with 2.5x speed. Kens project series from scratch inspired me to start my own project. The result you can see in this video. But it was a lot of time and effort to get to this point. So, its a nice compliment, when someone thinks, that my project cant be from a beginner. Also, I hope this motivates people, who are now at the beginning.\n",

      "8403 Hey, Ken, I'm new to the data science, so I wanted to ask you a question. A lot of people say that the most important thing that data scientist should make is \"value\". However, I saw a lot of popular notebooks on Kaggle with complex algorithms but without any explanation of the reasoning behind them (e.g. doing sentiment analysis on restaurant reviews but without mentioning why it might be beneficial). So my question is \"Is explaining the reasons behind your actions and mentioning the value of your work important?\"\n",

      "8638 Liking this Review series! Absolutely agree with you at 14:38 that tree-based methods may be useful for giving feature importance but the lack of direction in which the features influences the model render it less useful than that of linear model's regression coefficients. Recently, I have been experimenting with the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library (https://github.com/slundberg/shap) and it is filling this need by also giving the direction at which the feature influences the base values along with the magnitude as in linear models, and the great thing is that it works on nearly all ML algorithms too (tree-based included).\n",

My biggest issue is that I don't have any computer science exposure. I was a biology/pre-med major, and I've been working in the pharmaceutical field for 4 years. I have a decent grip on statistical methods, but again no knowledge of coding outside of excel and a few lines in R.

Right now, I'm finishing my sophomore year and my first internship, but I'm finding it increasingly hard to even get a response from data science-related roles. I'm worried that this will be a snapshot of what's to come even when I graduate, do you think a Master will help with getting past the initial resume screening, or is it not worth it if it's not from a more recognized school?

So far on my journey, I have acquired a Certificate in Data Science from UCI (very high-level stuff, didn't really go into great depths, mostly theory), but I always have these doubts that I am too old to get into tech or that I don't have enough real world experience to get into tech.

In the end it does not matter how many incredible projects someone made, if they can't showcase and explain them clearly, even if this sounds harsh. This really motivates me to improve my own resume, I'm working on it but because I'm from Germany I actually have to translate my homepage so that I can send it out to international recruiters if needed, and that takes up some time as well :D I think your advice really is valuable even to people outside the US, even though of course the formalities may differ, f.e. in Europe it is much more common (or even expected) to include a personal photo on the resume, but I think that the essence of interviews and what recruiters look for is generally the same across the countries, especially for larger companies like FANG etc. I think the interview process does not differ much. For smaller companies though there can of course be differences.\n",

      "8831 Hi, I have a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering. I've been out of college for about 2.5 years now and have recently made the decision to switch to Data Science. I have a decent level of programming experience from my time in college/work with Matlab and C++. And I'm trying to figure out what the best path to this would be for me? I'm not really in a position to stop working, but my company will pay for me to go back to school up to 10k per year for graduate programs or 5k per year for certifications. Over the past month I've been utilizing as many online free resources to learn as possible including kaggle, LinkedIn learning, etc. What would you recommend is the best move for someone in my position? Do you think after I build a few projects I could start applying to entry level Data analyst positions?\n",
      "8832 So I did small examples while learning this material during my MBA, but didn't have the time to delve deeper into projects. What sort of data science projects would you recommend for an MBA to learn?\n",
      "8833 Hi, thanks for the video. I was really looking for this kind of answers. Although I already signed in the 365 data science course in Udemy before watching this. Just I have a question that terrifies me. Do I need to be a math wizard? Just the word algorithm terrifies me. I always struggle with numbers, even now I miss the most common and simple operations. I'm doing a statistics course in Khan Academy to catch up as fast as I can. But still freak out about it. What can you suggest? Not to panic? Or focus myself inf hard core maths, statistics, algebra...??? Hope you can answer.\n",
      "8834 beautiful video ken\n",
      "8835 Hi Ken, I started web scraping and made necessary changes to retrieve estimate_salary as Described in the video, but I failed. By the way, you have inspired a lot to me man, thank you so much. Keep posting great content, very excited for upcoming content.\n",

      "8844 Ken, thank you for your content! I participated in Stanford's 5 week course titled Code in Place and we're now in our final project phase. We spent the past five weeks learning Python. I found your videos through searching \"data science for beginners what is data science\" in efforts of getting ideas for what kind of final project I want to try The 5 week pace of the course was absolutely too fast for me, but I am so glad I found your channel. After this video in particular, this is definitely a path I want to continue learning about (ie what new information can I read by using methods beyond my usual qualitative analysis approach to things), and you've already helped me create a learning path beyond this course. Thank you! I look forward to more content\n",
      "8845 Hey Ken, I appreciate that you put a small summary in the description!\n",
      "8846 This really is great stuff Ken! Out of curiosity, Why don't you have a patreon page or something? You content is so valuable to aspiring data scientists, I'm sure people would want to support you.\n",

      "8848 I paused the video and read your wall posts and it was amazing. Your channel looks pretty amazing too. I was wondering what capstone projects to work on and I think I'll find an answer within your material. Great job!\n",
      "8849 Hey Ken, I don't know you, but the algorithm recommended this vid. I think it is better if you start off with describing a bit about who you are otherwise I don't think the title itself can really grab people's attention because you haven't established validity. Maybe just something to think about for future vids.\n",
      "8850 Hey Ken great videos!! I am a relative newbie and up until know I have been following along smoothly with no errors however with the step of running the \"wsgi.py\" file and running then curl X etc in the command line....I am getting the same error you were however the your fix did not work for me (@21:54 time stamp) and I made sure to copy the code you had to the letter.

Either the server is overloaded or there is an error in the application.</p> Any ideas?? Sean\n",
      "8851 I have become very confused with the different advice various people give regarding data science. The coding languages like R and python seem to give the user a more technical and intricate level of work but these don't seem inviting to me when there are options like Matlab available which is significantly more user friendly especially for beginners. I graduated with an engineering degree last year, I have since tried to study machine learning with python after having no background in the language and it seemed more difficult to study and memorize all the different algorithms one has to go and create or the the different uses of packages like numpy. On the other hand I started a course on data science with MATLAB and the ease of graphing and using visual aids seemed to make Matlab a more desirable choice for me. That being said, I don't really hear of Matlab being a buzz-word in the data science community, why is this? Where would Matlab be more applicable than software languages like python or R?\n",

      "8857 Hello, Ken. Regarding the applicability of your advices outside the US, I can speak about Brazil (my home country) and France (the country I currently live). Basically, everything you said so far applies equally to both places, specially regarding the number of pages in the CV. I've been working with engineering for some time now, and in Brazil I see a certain tendency of giving more importance to soft skills than to technical skills, at least in my area. The idea is that you can teach somebody how to program, for example, but it's really hard to teach someone how to have be a good team player. Watching youtube videos about data science I have the impression that on the US the job interviews focus a lot on asking technical questions, but I'm not sure if it's the same through all types of jobs.\n",
      "8858 Very intuitive. Thanks. I've a Master degree in Physics (specialization: particle physics). I'm thinking of diving into data science. So, apart from what you have said, would you be able to guide me in this regard specifically? What would be the best case scenario in my case?

I've been exploring data science for a few years now, and I believe I have all the skills necessary (R, Python, SQL, PowerBI, statistics,...). I would love to get into the sports analytics field professionally, but I haven't found the right channels to do that yet. I'm also in the Chicago area, so I was wondering if you have any specific tips to network with people in the sports analytics field? In your experience, what are some of the interesting organizations in the IL area and how would you recommend approaching hiring decision makers?\n",

      "8896 Ken, Very cool analysis. I wonder if you could get the data on strikeouts. I remember seeing some discussion that the Astros' team strikeout % was significantly lower than the MLB average. If that is the case, then that would give them an advantage in a number of ways - strikeouts are a key metric for pitchers, especially in high leverage late-game situations. Really looking forward to part two. Baseball analytics is a particular favorite of mine!\n",

      "8908 Best advice from a data scientist: 1) nothing is what it seems. If you have yet to enter the data science and analyst field (still in school or studying), what you think a data scientist is day to day is wrong. So keep an open mind. Were not writing algorithms on the windows of dorm rooms. Hint: 90% of our work is research and data preparation/cleaning. If you want to be a kick ass data scientist, learn how to interview data users. Coding is the easy part. 2) did I say be open minded? Good. Now tell yourself over and over and over, almost no companies know what data science is. And neither do you. So let me tell you what data science is: its the ability to understand and manipulate data and/or information. Thats it. Data science is not Python. If I give you an excel sheet of data and ask you to create a pivot that shows me counts and sums of those counts and you do that; you are being a data scientist. Your ability to code in a certain language does not = data science. Im telling you this, cause being and looking this internet conceived data scientist part/person is a misconception and can kill your dream of ever growing into a great data scientist. Give yourself credit for what you know. And be confident that because you can analyze data in excel, you can also learn object oriented programming. 3) nothing is what it seems. Just cause a job title doesnt say data scientist doesnt mean your not going to do data science work. Im a business intelligence developer. I manage data from Oracle, SQL Server and Cloud data lakes. When I sit down at my desk, I open Dbeaver, SQL Server, Visual Studio and Jupyter Notebook. All these IDEs get used daily. That means I coding in 3 languages at a minimum daily. ONLY ONE of those languages is Python. My job title is NOT data scientist. My point in all my rubbish talk is that data science is a lot like the cloud. Over 10 years ago, the cloud concept became the rage. And yet most companies are still struggling to implement or even leverage the cloud. Data science is sadly going down that path too. Most companies and their managers are posting jobs to hire data scientists and as long as the job posting has a requirement of must know Python, its a data scientist job posting. However, 99% of the managers hiring data scientist dont know what a data scientist is themselves. And those managers couldnt tell you what a Jupyter notebook is. Or how to write/print hello world in Python. Yet theyre interviewing candidates for Python development. If and when you enter the so called data scientist career path, be open minded. This is a journey not a goal. Enjoy the trip. Be flexible. Knowledge trumps job titles. If you want to get paid the big bucks, be the most valuable player. That means work on everything sent your way. And show off your skills. Good luck!\n",

I have a question regarding your second point of going back to grad school/not wanting to go back to school and still wanting to work in data science. Why do you consider Physics to be an integral part of learning in the field?

      "9027 Hi Ken, thank you for the great video! As a four-year experience data/risk analyst, I think your suggestion makes a lot of sense. A master degree could be a great choice if I want to move to a data scientist type of role. I wonder if you could share your thought a little bit about a master in DS vs Stats. My concern is DS programs are relatively new, and maybe most hiring managers are suspicious about the program and expectation of candidates are not established yet, so they would rather choose candidates with stats background. And plus, fundamental knowledge of stat could potential help solving hard core tasks in career later. Could you please share your thought on this please? Thanks!\n",

I think you said that... Anyway I was wondering if you had any tips on pursuing these roles? And in honor of your 10,000 subscriber and 100th video, I just like to say that I took an online SQL course and somewhere I discovered your SQL Lahman's Baseball tutorial and it was great as a supplement.

I am a few months into learning about Machine Learning, but it is only since I started focusing on actually doing projects that I actually feel like I am beginning to understand what is going on. Before, I was focusing on programming, algebra, statistics, and I felt like I was just going through the motions, but now that I started trying to do the projects its like I am waking up and finally learning. Wish I had gotten stuck into projects much sooner.\n",
      "9050 Another Great Video , Thanks man\n",
      "9051 You forgot the step where you learn the basic concepts of data science and machine learning. \"Basic statistics\" won't cover that, and copying code you found on Kaggle without understanding why things are done that way is a good way to pick up some terrible habits. Like not understanding overfitting, for example.\n",

      "9069 Hi Ken, I have a question for you: I'm studying social sciences at the moment with a specialization in quantitative data analysis. We're not just doing basic stuff, I already did courses on geodata analysis, network analysis (even did an analysis of Twitter communities with data that I scraped with the Twitter rest API), multilevel models, structural equation models and causal analysis. But we have no courses on machine learning (actually there would have been a course this semester, but it got dropped because of corona -.- I guess it's too difficult to run a Zoom stream for a guy working with machine learning, idk...). And we also didn't do much on efficient coding / speeding up the code. I'm mostly working with R. What do you say would be a good next step to get deeper into data science with that pretty solid foundation of knowledge on statistics? Can you recommend courses, books or other sources for my situation? All the data science sources that I found were starting from zero which was a bit annoying for me. Thanks!\n",

      "9155 I'm in Ireland so the set up is a little different but my original degree was in social science and now I'm doing a higher diploma in Data Science. This is a post grad qualification that is an add on to your degree but it's not quite a masters either. Personally I'm coinciding that with different online courses or certificates. The diploma is two years part time and it is designed for people with no data science background so there is a lot to cram in. Naturally there will be area's that i'm weaker in or where the diploma does not go into detail as I would like so I use certificates to fill those gaps. Mid term term breaks, winter breaks and soon summer breaks are a good time to do these when lectures are no longer running and you've finished up exams. In saying that university education in Ireland is a lot cheaper. My first degree was free and this higher diploma is around 4000 euro in total so I don't mind spending an extra little bit to do some courses in my own time.\n",

I have a Bachelor of Science in Business Administration degree, and I would love to transition to the field of Data Science. I am planning to do that by enrolling into the Masters Program. Another reason why I want to get the Masters is because I am planning to immigrate into another country, so getting a degree there would be one of the best options for me, as I can't get a job in DS right away. During my university years, I've been introduced to most of the basic concepts of Statistics and Calculus. I've completed a few DS courses online together with some CS and Programming Extension courses. My question is, do you think getting a Masters degree in Data Science is suitable for me, and what are the chances of me getting accepted into the program? Thank you very much!\n",

I had done coding, mathematical modeling, and matlab script simulation during the working years. i had done a lot of maths in high school, especially the whole of statistics. i am currently thinking of doing a bootcamp in my country, which originally cost USD 20k, but able to get a discount down to USD 5k. its is a twelve week course, and i plan to take 2 months leave for the course. i agree with you about the networking the bootcamp can offer and also skeptical that all the online certificates can land me a data scientist job. what do you think? thanks in advance. great vedios that you had uploaded. i learnt a lot.\n",

Can you shed some more light on that? During the last five years were you working as a data scientist/analyst, or is this something that you pursue in your spare time? I am wondering because I am trying to transition into a career related to data science. Specifically, I would to work in a role related quantitative research in the finance industry. I have been studying ~20 hours/week the last six months, and on and off the previous six months. I have been using resources such as Datacamp and Quantopian to practice and learn.

That aside the system for my academic calendar doesnt do much to support good self study so Im still a beginner at everything although Ive been doing fairly well with my assignments. This makes it hard for me to present myself to companies because immediately they see youre about to be a graduate with an Msc. in data science, they expect the most from you which is fair but then to someone like me who had zero background in this course before starting, it is quite intimidating. It makes me wonder if theres ever a company out there who will have the patience to allow me to grow in my knowledge whiles still contributing to the job requirements.\n",

      "9273 Hi Ken, My main goal in the next 3 years to become a proficient data scientist. Because I recently only discovered my passion for data science and I did my bachelor's in Urban planning. Now I have to learn quickly all the concepts and be competent in applying those into real-world problems which I am sure I can. But my only worry is to get an entry-level job in the data science field since I don't have any paper qualifications or experience from my current job. Any tips on that how I could land a new job in this field to gain experience?\n",
      "9274 Ken, this is fantastic! Thank you.\n",
      "9275 I would start by not learning it and start learning software engineering. Data scientist are looked down in the tech industry. Any software engineer can do their job but it is boring as hell. Apart from that, your end product is nothing but a power point or report showing your results. Who would feel proud of that?\n",

Please guide on the exact course & skills to be acquire & relavent topics one can study to become Data analyst (Specific this component only) for non programming individuals only. I can't see any crisp content or precise topics one should master. For eg - How much & which type of modules in python for Data analysis. What topics in Statistics for Data analysis. What depth in SQL and so on & the list is long. So please throw some light.\n",

      "9288 Hey, I have just stumbled upon your channel as I was trying to find some good resources regarding data science. I am currently a third year student doing a computer scene degree with integraded masters. Next year, I have the option to choose some optional modules like: Machine learning technologies or foundations of data science. What do you think I should take? Should I take the ML course and try to understand data science in my free time? I can only take one of those 2. Sorry for the long comment. Your countent is great and I cant wait to see some more stuff from you!!\n",

      "9291 I am an IP consultant, I develop interest in Data Science during this lockdown, my goal is to become a good data analyst by Jan 2021...do you think it is realistic?\n",
      "9292 Thanks for this video ! Very very helpful. I have 8 years of experience working in bioinformatics and dealing with big data from genomics and genetics. I have been looking into transitioning to sports analytics as a new career option . I do have basic data science skills from my bioinformatics work experience but I don't have any specific projects I have done independently in the sports domain. Do you think it would be useful for me to pursue a sports analytics degree before I start looking for opportunities in this domain ? Or would the sports industry still consider me as an eligible candidate based on my programming/machine learning experience while handling big data in the biology domain, even if I don't have real-world experience in sports ? I do follow several sports enthusiastically such as football, soccer and basketball and I am aware of all the terminologies associated with these sports. I'd really appreciate your feedback. Thanks !\n",
      "9293 What wide monitor do you have ?\n",
      "9294 Ken, thanks for all of the informative advice. Do you think your Masters in Commerce which lead you into a analyst role provided you any significant foundation for programming/data science? Also, is the switch from data analytics to data science difficult?\n",
      "9295 Such videos are made by people who want to earn money while trying to become a Data Scientist.\n",

      "9297 I've just started learning Data science and interested in football analytics a lot ! Should i start with big projects immediately or should I go gradually ? Also it'd be really helpful if you could post a tutorial video of your analysis. And if it's not a trouble, do you mind if i contact you via LinkedIn ? Also can you suggest some online communities to engage with ?\n",
      "9298 Was nice to see near the end of the video that even you too had to look something up! Further backed up your video saying that no real data scientist memorizes everything. We appreciate you for all that your doing!\n",
      "9299 Hello Ken, I love your videos, thanks so much for it! Do you use SQL in your projects? In other videos usually the people recommend start by SQL due the amount of data, what do you think?\n",
      "9300 Hello, Ken. Very nice video, as usual. I've started my Data Science journey a few weeks ago, and I agree with your comments. I'm an engineer and work with computational mechanics for a while now, so I have a quite good understand about algorithms, programming, optimization, and stuff like this. What I figured out is that I already know some stuff about DS, just the terminology I was used to is different, which is great. I have in mind to create my own (much worst) version of scikit-learn, I mean, to implement the major ML algorithms myself, as you suggested. What I think it's also very useful is to create my own cheat sheets and reference notebooks, instead of just using some source already available, because this will force me to think more. Going through the packages' documentations and checking all functions that might be useful can also be a good idea, and this is slightly easier if the person has already some coding experience. I enjoy Coursera courses, and I'm relying on them to build my basic skills, but definitely what will help me most is to write my own codes. Cheers\n",
      "9301 sick new intro\n",
      "9302 hi sup? u know which platforms or web that offers FREE certificates ? thx\n",
      "9303 Hey Ken, Thanks for valuable info. A quick Q&A can / should data science learn online as you know lots of video will be find here of 11 hrs to 15 hrs learning OR need to go through proper channel of learn like enroll in paid classes with renounced institute What's your opinion ?\n",
      "9304 Thanks for this video. I am an \"analyst\" trying to decide if I want to become a data scientist but it seems like some of the things I dislike about my role may be the position and not the company. I'm the only analyst with nobody to ask questions, less prof development opportunities, and nobody knows what I do :( The autonomy/expert thing kills me! I'd much rather have a team and people who understand benefit of my work. Have you experienced being in your own little corner or being way ahead of your companies' resources?\n",
      "9305 You rock Ken\n",
      "9306 Hey Ken, hope you are doing good. Thanks for all the videos. Enjoying it thoroughly. In learning with case studies how do I know which algorithm I should choose? Also, can you upload a project that starts with data collection, which has a lot of missing values in it, where more time is spent on data cleaning and pre-processing as I heard from many DataScientist that they spend the majority of their time in Data preprocessing?\n",

      "9324 I'm currently finishing up law school between now and July (when I have to submit my thesis). Between now and the end of August though I would like to get through the 365 intro to stats course, 365 Python programming course, as well as 365 Data Science course. I do have to be extremely careful of burnout as you pointed out. However, I am extremely motivated to make this transition into Data Science. There's a Data Science bootcamp here in Toronto that I'm keen to attend which I'd hope to start in October. I'd like to go into that Bootcamp with a solid base, as most of the attendees in the Data Science stream seem to have solid technical experience.\n",
      "9325 Thank you for providing your insights its always good to have some guidance from the people already in the domain.\n",
      "9326 Hey Ken! Thank you for all your videos. I was wondering if this changes any for people pursuing sports analytics. I was also wondering how to start with projects for sports analytics. I am currently 16 years old and am trying to learn coding and statistics during this time through free edx and coursera, but I still don't seem to be able to do any projects, especially ones that are new and intuitive. I want to publish new work, but over summer if I am only good enough to do projects that maybe others have done, is that still worth publishing? Thank you for any advice.\n",

      "9332 Ken, do you have any sport analysis resources that you can recommend?\n",
      "9333 Thanks Ken for a great video on the roadmap of learning data science! The intro animation graphics looks awesome! Well said, accountability indeed helps to keep us motivated and pushing it to meet the goals we set. Being accountable for one another in this comment community is surely a great way to move forward in learning data science together. \n",
      "9334 Hey Ken, could you do a project from scratch that would involve feature selection, feature scaling, PCA, data normalization etc. I did see your series of Data Scientist job positions from scratch but would like to know how the above concepts are incorporated in the project. Thanks.\n",

      "9337 Love the new intro Ken !! Definitely agree with staring projects as soon as you can. I spent too much time learning about functions and things I could do but constantly forgot them because I was never doing projects and applying them. Alot of my time was spent learning things but I never knew when or how to apply them because I never did projects at first!\n",
      "9338 Firstly, thanks for sharing your knowledge ! I live n Brazil and I'm graduate in Computer Engineer, recently signed a premium plan on DataCamp and I'm enjoying it.\n",
      "9339 I discovered 365 Data Science by your recommendation at the start of this pandemic. Their videos are highly informative and involve very detailed projects that will help you understand key concepts, as well as open the door for you to start making your own types of projects through what you will have learned. So, I definitely recommend them as well.\n",
      "9340 Goal is to learn the basis of ML in the next 6 months. I'm going to come back to this comment\n",

      "9346 That new intro of yours does look really cool, I have to say! :D I agree to the statement that DS has really changed over the past few years. Because it is such a young field I think that the landscape will change dramatically even for the next 5-10 years. My personal goal as a (now) first year university student is to stand out amongst my peers, more than 50% of every CS student seems to be interested in ML, but only a very small percentage of those really commit to the entire journey, which I really want to do. Have a nice weekend :)\n",

      "9388 Ken, Great video and insights on preparing a strong resume! Agreed that documentation is a plus for potential employers, a well documented code/notebook goes a long way in reproducibility of data science projects. Speaking of making websites and hosting on GitHub, Hugo (https://gohugo.io/) is a great tool, it is a static site generator that automatically creates a website directly from markdown files and it could be hosted on the github.io. Best of all, there's a large selection of themes to select from. Personally, I use it to create our research group's website http://codes.bio/\n",

      "9401 How can i export the pandas DataFrame for the scraped tweeter data as CSV to save on my system memory ??\n",
      "9402 Great video! Generally I think the younger someone is (or in general the earlier someone stands in their career/education) the more impressive extraordinary projects become. If you're a high school student and you create your own DS project whilst collecting own data, that is a lot more impressive than if you're in your final graduate year. Even though it is never too late to start, I really want to try and make cool projects early on so that I can build momentum as early as possible. With the DS market becoming more and more competitive, I think these uncommon achievements are going to be valued more and more, especially in larger companies (FANG etc.) where already today they are probably more of a requirement than an add-on. Nevertheless, great video! I really hope to land an awesome internship myself in the coming year(s).\n",

      "9406 Hey Ken, thanks for the great video. I have been watching all your videos and they are greatly helpful! I have a question though. At 2:04, you mentioned that \"if you want to set yourself apart, you should consider doing unique projects on the dataset you personally collected.\" Are there any efficient ways I can collect new dataset?\n",
      "9407 Hey Ken, great video ;) So I have done a project where ive scrapped data from a website, performed EDA and built a classifier analysing the performance of various ML model. How exactly do you suggest mentioning this on my resume? Like can you give me an example on how to go about writing it? Thanks\n",
      "9408 Great video, Ken, hope you dont mind me sharing. Ive hosted 1-2 interns every year, and agreed with all your points, particularly the successful interns were those with the skills youve mentioned (e.g. R or Python) as well as a GitHub portfoilio of hobby projects (reaffirming their interest and passion for data science). And one of the most important point is to double check that we addressed the potential employer with their name instead of Dear Sir/Madam, it goes to show that we have at least personalized the letter to them. Once again, great video and great insights Ken!\n",
      "9409 Hi, Ken. Thanks for sharing helpful tips! I wish I found your advices in earlier years in college. Im a new graduate without any intern experience. Can you give me an idea of how I can find research opportunities at this point? Thanks in advance!\n",

      "9444 Hey Ken, (warning: longer comment incoming) I've been following you for a few months now and I've been thinking \"Man, I really need to write a comment stating how much I appreciate this channel\", but I have been putting it of for long enough, this video finally drove me to the keyboard. It is really inspiring to see you consistently trying to upload informative videos about Data Science and really giving back to the community. You are a great motivation for me to keep going and striving towards a career in Data Science (or even Machine Learning Engineering). I clicked through your social links and noticed that you have a really well documented system including your GitHub, personal website. Medium posts and this YouTube-Channel. With a full time job besides all of that it is really impressive to me how you can manage all of these sources and be so consistent with it. I'd love to have my project reviewed by you, even though at the moment my GitHub is my least well documented source (xD). But you definitely inspired me to put more time and effort into polishing personal projects and really not letting loose on those last 20%. I am almost certain, that within a year or two your channel will become very impactful in the DS community and that you will see very positive results. Your content is very informative and helping. If I tried to point out some minor areas of improval it would actually not be based on the content itself, but rather on aspects surrounding it (such as presentation, background noise, ... ) but I am sure you are aware of this, recently I have noticed quite some improvement in those areas as well, so all I can say is chapeau! I am really excited to see how far you will come in the next months, you definitely won me as a loyal fan of yours :)\n",

I have a question regarding the data cleaning. In the video, you manually scrolled through the data to find odd values such as 'per hour', 'employer provided salary' etc. in the Salary Estimate column. But how would you find that kind of value when the data frame has hundreds of thousands or millions of rows?

I got on Kaggle for the first time and I was pretty excited to find these useable data sets to work on some of my data vis skills. Saw they were downloadable zip files and that immediately scared me, but I naively thought everyone else uses it and a quick google search brought up no safety concerns. After downloading about 3 data sets. I am pretty convinced i downloaded some malware. Got multiple warning signs from the browsers I use and then a bunch of random sites jumped up and teamviewer popped open. Immediately shut down and disconnected everything. Is this normal? Do you have any tips for safely downloading data sets etc?? Would really appreciate. Thanks\n",

In around 21-22minutes, you use : data.cylinders=pd.to_numeric(data.cylinders,errors=\"coerce\") . I do not really understand what does this function do, can you explain it? Thanks\n",
      "9632 Hi Ken - i really liked this as it avoids the complication of the API. Can you explain what is happening in line df=pd.DataFrame(t.__dict__ for t in tweets) ? I know you are converting from the tweet objects to a DataFrame but I don't understand the syntax. Thanks . Seamus\n",

We learn Python, R, SQL, AI, Statistics, Machine Learning techniques and in our Senior year we have to do an research project and develop a project for a companie. (You have the link here if you to check it out) https://www.iscte-iul.pt/course/291/bachelor-bsc-in-data-science Keep with the great work and I hope you do well with this channel, a lot of great content about DS here!\n",
      "9682 Good content. Can you do a video on ARIMA in Python and going through in details the ADF test, forecasting, train/test?\n",
      "9683 Hope you are fine now.\n",
      "9684 Thank you very much for this free invaluable content\n",
      "9685 Hey Everyone - It looks like the free 365 data science courses offer has expired. The rest of the resource that I mentioned in this video are free though: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ip50cXvpWY4\n",
      "9686 thanks for such wonderful word Ken !! But the link you shared above is redirecting to Udemy and are not free\n",
      "9687 If I were to want to get a job in this field would it be enough to learn these free courses and the information and to relay what I have learned to the hiring manager? Or would I need to get some sort of certification? Thanks.\n",
      "9688 Hi Ken, Edoardo Brizi here. We've spoken on LinkedIn and as I told you I'm one of your newer subscribers. I've been binge watching your videos since we've chatted and I wanted to give you props for the content you have on your channel. Very instructive and insightful! Best, E.B.\n",
      "9689 Hi Ken! Thanks for the video. I come from a humanties background and as of now don't exactly know what kind of position I want after a MSc in Data Science and Business Analytics, but I think the skills can be applied to a wide range of sectors and industries and I can explore more during grad school. In a nutshell, I do want to gain these skills and open more doors in the future, do you think this is a less mature/thought-through motivation to pursue such a degree?\n",
      "9690 Great stuff! just started using Matplotlib today. Man thats confusing \n",
      "9691 Your content is so underrated.\n",
      "9692 Another great video Ken!! Could you do a beginner project from start to finish video ? Maybe include a part two to it where you show how to display the data using Tableau ? -Mario\n",
      "9693 Hi Sir, just wanted to ask that if how do I present my interactive charts online. GREAT VIDEO!!! (*U*) <3 :{\n",
      "9694 Hi Ken, Thank you for your advice! This has been very helpful as an aspiring data scientist. I was wondering if I could get your thoughts on this project I am currently working on and if it is good enough to put on my portfolio. To quickly summarize, I did EDA on my Spotify listening history and merged it with a Spotify features dataset that listed features of each song (For example, tempo, major, acousticness, and valence are a couple examples). I wanted to see if there was a correlation between the songs I usually listen to and the features. However, there was very little correlation so I said that the model (using multiple linear regression) I would build would be very inaccurate at predicting, and showed the inaccuracy by building it and finding its mean squared error (which was very large; although there were some predictions that were close). In your opinion, would this suffice as a good project? If not, do you have any insight on how I could improve? Thank you for all your videos!\n",
      "9695 Can you please suggest some tutorials for learning deployment of Machine learning models\n",
      "9696 Great advice bro, had to give it a like and subscribed\n",
      "9697 Thanks for this video! I hope you could make more videos like this. It could be helpful also for you to understand it more. Thank you so much!\n",
      "9698 Hey is jupyter notebook too slow to run, Everytime I login again after a break I have to rerun all the cells and still notice some of the cells are unexecuted ,it's like running a same codes for many a times before you move ahead it's so frustrating ,is their a way to handle all this ?\n",
      "9699 your videos are amazing\n",
      "9700 Awesome!\n",
      "9701 Thanks a ton for this video Ken! I recently dropped out of my physics PhD after going through some hard times financially and after falling in love with data science. Your videos are absolutely invaluable to me and I'm very appreciative of the work you put into them!\n",
      "9702 I don't feel so bad now spending half the time I devote each day to acquiring data analyst/science skills in learning math: linear algebra, statistics and probability, and calculus. A live stream video reviewing resumes or projects would be highly valuable. Now back to practicing multiplying matrices I go!\n",
      "9703 I will do as you suggest and watch those videos before asking you :) if you downt have it already, maybe some playlist would be a good idea. My recommended order of watching, See these before asking me questions. I would at least like it. I plan on watching all of the videos, but with the corona situation, closed kindergartens and schools, Im trying to learn statistical analysis while having 3 small kids home, so it may take some time. Anyway you have already given me the most clear information on what a data scientist actually do, and I only have a little more than a year left of my bachelors. So thank you \n",
      "9704 Awesome this is a very good concept to share and you are right most people watching this are self directed. Thanks for sharing .\n",
      "9705 @Ken Jee hello ken, i am pursuing masters degree in data science and planned to graduate in August. I am now worried about job market due the present situation. How bad it would be impacted in terms of data science job market and economy? Is there any crisis we are facing? Please make a video if possible!!\n",
      "9706 Good book suggestion and the time to publicise its values. I finished Young's book at the end of last year, and it really helped me be a more attentive learner. I utilised a Trello board to track down the list of resources - following the meta-learning principle. Fully agree with you on the other parts as well like directness and feedback. I found that to be the keystone habit for me in last few months, as I always regurgitate information to the point where I can explain concepts like JOINs/LEFT JOINs without having to refer repeatedly to other resources. Thanks Ken!\n",
      "9707 Nice man. I've been trying to get a copy of Ultralearning but Amazon's all backed up on shipping because of the situation \n",
      "9708 yes\n",
      "9709 Another quality video Ken! I love non fiction books, so this \"review a book and apply it to data science\" type of style is right up my alley. I think it brings in a lot more video ideas too!\n",
      "9710 I started my data science course work based on your suggestions thanks Ken\n",
      "9711 Great video! I would love to see you do live streams and engage with your audience. Your channel is small enough to talk to your audience but should take advantage of that before it goes big ;)\n",
      "9712 Good job, thanks for the video.\n",
      "9713 If you would be interested in me doing a live stream where I review resumes or projects, please let me know in the comments below! Ultralearning Book: @t\n",
      "9714 Keep going pro\n",
      "9715 Thank you, Ken! Im taking up algorithms from scratch right now, just the basics, and you often mention, that data science is about using the best way to solve the task. This kinda scares me. Are there, in reality, effective and reliable ways to make sure, that the algorithm and solution for a task were chosen correctly. Should I be less scared by this? Ive just started learning, and for me this seems, that experimenting can be endless. Would be cool, if you break or confirm this fear thank you again, I love your videos! \n",
      "9716 Videos where you review someone's projects and CV would definitely be valuable. Keep up the good work! :)\n",
      "9717 Hey Ken, Great video! Right now Im in the beginning phase. I am enrolled in Johns Hopkins course for data science due to employment benefits and its free. Since Hopkins is biostatistics and clinical research based, the course is taught in R. I am learning because I want a job in data science, but not exclusively in biostatistics. I also prefer Python over R. My question is: should I enroll in another course that is Python based and focus on that for a more generalized approach or should I just stick with the Hopkins course? Thank you!\n",
      "9718 I like your style Ken. You're not pretentious with your information. Please keep it up. You're an asset to the community.\n",
      "9719 HI Ken, Great Video, I have a question about the project. Any recommend project to build for portfolio. I have done couple real estate analysis and 2 recommendation project. I want to explore more on the machine learning part during this break.\n",
      "9720 Hey Ken! This definitely is a great tutorial but I'm also a beginner as well just like the others. Could you possibly do some simple beginner projects from start to finish using the Spyder IDE ? Definitely have the time on my hands now due to the corona virus and i feel that would be a big help to me and the other beginners out there !\n",
      "9721 @Ken_Jee Thank you, for this tutorial But when I try to scraping a data, it's not giving me only a couple of tweets even thou I'm sure the tags I used having more than thousand of tweets, any help? Also, is Arabic is considered in this model? Many thanks\n",
      "9722 Hey Ken, what tools should I have on my laptop to use for python data science projects? Do you use an IDE?\n",
      "9723 Hey Ken, Great video. Im actually improving my python skills during this time. FYI you got some good Towards Data Science articles\n",
      "9724 I really like your structured video content and explanation. thanks and keep making videos\n",
      "9725 This was immensely helpful, thanks for putting in the time to make this vid!\n",
      "9726 The only constant in data science is that it's always changing! It's important to always learn new technologies. Thanks Ken for the motivation!\n",
      "9727 You spent almost half of your presentation talking about Machine learning(feature engineering, clustering, regression etc). In my humble opinion Data science has a lot to do with other aspects other than Machine learning. I realized many people focus a lot on machine learning which shrinks a lot of the aspects of data science. Kaggle, for example, encourages folks to hone their machine learning skills. Kaggle isn't a good place to learn full fledge data science skills. Data collection, Data Cleaning, Data manipulation, Exploratory Data analyses where all left out. Kaggle mostly brings ready-made datasets which limits many kagglers the ability to effectively develop their data science skills. Nevertheless I sincerely appreciate the value you have provided through your video. Thank you\n",
      "9728 Sir Ken, what IDE are you using? Seems better than Jupyter.\n",
      "9729 Great video as always, but I will say this is a serious understatement. Now that I'm out of work, I am ever so glad that I have decided to pursue this career path. Three great reasons to pursue data science: 1. Do something positive for society and gain a strong sense of purpose. 2. Something to keep the mind stimulated which can greatly help with depression and anxiety. 3. A solid career that can potentially help someone avoid being homeless and going down a dark path. I think these are solid enough reasons to purse this field.\n",
      "9730 Hi Ken, loved this video! Could you do a Clustering one? Stay safe!\n",
      "9731 In general, python and R are very similar in my opinion.\n",
      "9732 Thanks for finding the positives during this time of uncertainty\n",
      "9733 still no discord? its okay ill keep waiting haha\n",
      "9734 Keep going Ken, I was impressed by your NBA project though.\n",
      "9735 Thanks Ken, just found your channel! Was an engineer in college, but drifted towards fitness and nutrition coaching as my career went on. Industry is rocked right now, so I'm learning some Data Science on the side, and your videos are helping :)\n",
      "9736 Great video. When you say you expect the work culture to shift towards employees working from home, do you mean in the short-term i.e. while the pandemic is still going on, or do you see this just being the \"new\" working environment? Interesting insight.\n",
      "9737 Can you suggest a good youtube channel or website for learning a good amount of python for data science.\n",
      "9738 Thankyou ken\n",
      "9739 Whenever I see that Ken Jee notification I drop everything I'm doing to watch it\n",
      "9740 Couldn't agree more. Working on a data set about the virus during this time. So many people have created really insightful notebooks on Kaggle already!\n",
      "9741 Ive been learning a lot using my iPhone and Ive gotten to that stage above the usage of a phone, kind of difficult getting a laptop but hopefully someday Ill be able get one to practice with, Thanks for your motivations.\n",
      "9742 Sooooo true!!! No one is realizing that without data scientists right now, millions more would die! They need people to work through statistics on illnesses, especially COVID-19! Good video!!\n",
      "9743 Great video! Im starting a statistical analysis course tomorrow morning I had discrete math, and algorithms and data structures last year, so I have been looking forward to this course. I was thinking about doing 2 math courses in my electives next year, pure mathematics for programmers and further discrete mathematics :)\n",
      "9744 Hi Ken, this video help me a lot, but there's an error that I get said \"Traceback (most recent call last) : \" and there's a lot of error message down below anyway to fix it?\n",

      "9751 I absolutely love this!! Finally something specific to learn from. Do more do more. Have you ever tried the intel Movidius neural compete stick btw? And another question. Are you skilled with NoSQL? I just had a term paper using Cassandra, MongoDB and Neo4j. I got an 89% on it. I could almost cry. I put everything into that. Used 3x the time estimation. I might actually complain about the grade. But I have the same professor In 3 courses next year, it might not be smart. Anyway! Keep doing ones like this. They will get me trough the courses :)\n",
      "9752 Very interesting video Ken. Thanks a lot!! One question regarding Google Colab though. Do you use the TPU setup or the GPU setup? I've been told that TPU performance is a lot better than GPU's and I was curious what you actually use? Also, I recently got into Work From Home setup and it seems to me that you have a very minimalist-style setup where you can focus on your work efficiently. Would you be willing to share your setup if you don't mind in your future video? Hoping you are staying safe as well!\n",

      "9780 Great video Ken! Suggestion for a future video - \"Data Science and the Coronavirus\"\n",
      "9781 As always, great video! One idea I haven't heard of before is focusing on one project and learning only the specific skills necessary for that project. Everyone's experienced the overwhelm when it comes to beginning the Data Science / ML / DL journey, and we're usually hit with the, \"learn all of statistics, all of programming, and all of math\" mentality that is drilled into our heads. This can be enough to scare people away, and your advice really combats this while touching on the idea of running on passion and things you enjoy by picking a personal project or use case. It's really cool to see that you have a specific domain that you stay in for projects (sports and sports betting). My question is: Do you stay within that domain at work? If you do, do you suggest that we each choose a specific domain as well, and cater towards that when building a career and finding a job? If you don't, would you agree that it's still valuable to choose a specific domain? Do you think that your experience and expertise in sports / sports betting transfers over to your current job/position? Thanks for the video Ken!\n",
      "9782 I think that what worked for me can definitely work for you in this case. You need to be patient and consistent when learning this field. Feel free to comment any questions that you may have below!\n",
      "9783 In your opinion is a statistics' degree useful to become a data scientist or is completely useless?\n",
      "9784 What about adding a 2.5-point line a little bit closer to the basket than the current 3-point line (2 feet closer?), that would give a boost to the no-man's land and the now reluctantly taken and often frowned-upon mid-range jumper. And then moving the 3-point line a bit further away. I think this could eventually make the game more interesting. It only takes a bid getting used to 0.5 points; and if you are fouled while attempting a 2.5 point shot, the first time team gets 2 free-throws, next time this happens 3 free throws are rewarded. It might be worth a try. Haven't read that elsewhere as of yet.\n",
      "9785 Im in the second stage forsure, I hate it, it demotivated me, havent been working as hard because every time I get stuck I see the answer that I could never have though of with functions idek how they got, and Im like Ive been on this problem for an hour. Its like macro-patience and micro-results\n",
      "9786 It is a big honor to get such information from you , thank you so much !\n",
      "9787 yes, python is better in many ways, espetially for programming issues, but for data wrangling (dplyr etc.), data analisys, visualisation (ggplot) and modelling, there is nothing what comes close to tidyverse. I tried to transition to python in the academia, and it was just painful. cheers\n",

Im a recent math major graduate, was planning to go to med school but then I wanted to do something in my field (math) and I learned about data science and I instantly knew, Im doing DataQuest data science path, Do i even need a MS? Can you do a review of DataQuest? How much should I study a day? Ive been studying 6-8 hours a day, after I finish my full time dead end job, just so I can get into a company I want and start being a data scientist. Rn Im a beginner, just started in Feb, learned python, OOP, NumPy and Pandas and now Im doing data aggregation and cleaning. Anyways, where can I practice?

Since a batter only has a second or so to react to a pitch thrown, what if some batters might do better if they didn't believe they knew the sign and, therefore, might overthink the at bat?

      "9857 Thanks for this video Ken. I have a sports analytics problem for you. When the 3 point shot was first introduced in the NBA, I said start launching them. Traditionalists said, oh no, too risky, too many will ruin the game. 20+ years later 3 point shots are an integral part of any teams' strategy. OK, my question is regarding the 2 point conversion in football. My belief is that the 2 point conversion should be tried every time. Once a team gets used to it they will develop special teams just for the conversion. Plus, once fully developed, these plays could be used for any regular down inside the 5 yard line. The amount of dedicated plays could be unlimited - 2 QB's on the field, 5 running backs, non-traditional formations, etc. Not to mention how exciting the game would become. Do you have any supporting evidence that, over time, going for the 2 point conversion 100% of the time would pay off? I guess part of your problem is that you cannot measure what hasn't been tried.\n",

What are some real-life examples, software names, etc? What is your related real-life experience? I don't ask for a whole sophisticated tutorial, the basic overview kind of information would be enough, so a person from a non-technical background could learn how to implement Data Science in business.

      "9891 Ken, the 3 point shot means that defenses can no longer help against offensive ball penetration because 3 point shooters have become so expert and are stationed too far away from the basket. With the increase in dribbling ability along with an increase in athleticism to convert alley-oop dunks so easily, even the 2-0n-2 game has become impossible to stop. Basketball's offensive/defensive balance has been totally ruined. Defenses can neither take away the 3 point or 2 point game in today's NBA as the rules are currently set up. When there was only a 2 point basket, defenses could help on ball penetration and know that a distance shot would not destroy their ability to compete in the game. Moving the 3 point basket out further only exacerbates this problem by creating more space that a defense has to cover after positioning its resources to defend the 2 point game. If the defense chooses to shut down the 3 point shooters by staying with them, then the defense is decimated with the 2 point game. The NBA has a structural problem that data analytics cannot fix.\n",

      "9953 This is great. I've always wanted to go into data science, but I keep hearing the whole \"Go to college\" deal, and honestly, I can't do it now (I did college and that was a failure).\n",
      "9954 Thanks for the video, but why do yo have such a small screenshot of the code? Im watching this on an iPad and my eyesight sucks. Also, what is the point of having your image in the lower right-hand corner. Does you image make it easier to comprehend what concepts and ideas your expressing? All that negative space is distracting from your content, which is interesting e\n",

      "9965 Thanks for your video! Is the interview process for the internship roles the same as the full-time ones? For DS, what questions are recommended in leetcode? What about the coding languages? Is it better to use python rather than java or both are ok?\n",
      "9966 How do you establish online presence to be in this field? where do you usually get remote jobs in DS?\n",
      "9967 Thank you this helps a lot!\n",
      "9968 Would you recommend someone getting a data analyst internship before a data science internship? Or just go straight for a data science internship?\n",
      "9969 Great resolutions! Some of my comments: 1) Nice thought, but optimise for what makes sense to YOU, not to some arbitrary set of criteria of what qualifies a \"good code\" by engineers. But obviously if you can't efficiently read/reason about your own code - then improvements are due! Functions/Objets aren't ALWAYS the right way forward, and there are also pros and cons to speed of development VS meeting \"classic\" code standards. Machine Learning is NOT the same as traditional programming, and same measures of quality should not be blindly applied to both. 2) Good thought - but just keep in mind that something that can take a whole evening if you go to an event - can be \"consumed\" at 2x speed on youtube in 40 mins. Events are important for networking and benchmarking yourself against other professionals, but don't have high expectations of actually LEARNING from talks - it's rather inefficient. 3) Github is definitely a place to be. Good README are always appreciated. Please share everything you can - you never know who could benefit from it! 4) Kaggle is amazing platform - it could be very hard to get into their way of thinking (it's like a parallel universe at first), but there is also so much to learn there. Just keep in mind that any particular technology that is state of the art today - might be completely obsolete in a few years time. Approaches to the problem and ways of thinking don't change as often. 5) Best resolution possible! When you do your work truly end-to-end you really learn so much more. I would focus on K8S (that you mentioned earlier) - I think it is the future, and spending time learning AWS or Azure specific ML tools might not be the best investment of your time. My resolutions: 1) Own my work more end-to-end (same as your 5). Have a say both in how data is collected and presented to the DS team, as well as a say in how the final product looks and feels. NOT being just a \"cog\" in a chain, but truly understand meaning and impact of my work. 2) Get to a level of Master on Kaggle (same as your 4) if possible, or at least do a few public kernels. 3) Attempt to build side projects which other people who aren't data scientists can interact with (like that pix2pix live demo) 4) Get more certifications and accreditations related to IT and ML 5) Finally get into PyTorch properly and become an expert 6) Improve my ability to read/analyse scientific papers. (So I don't have to wait until some YouTuber reviews them to get an idea about what's going on in our field) 7) Get a grip on Probabilistic Programming - I've been struggling with it for quite some time, and I think I'll be able to make it useful soon! Thank you for an interesting and relatable video!\n",
      "9970 I am studying BCA (Bachelor of Computer Application) in India . I want to have a ms in data science from a institute. But in our country (India) all institute provide PG diploma in Data Science. Can you guide me in which country and which institute i can get a degree MS in Data Science with a handsome salary of job.\n",
      "9971 My resolution is to be as ready as I can be for when I start my masters in data science program at Denver next fall. I will be using a lot of Codecademy, Dataquest, Udemy, and Kahn Academy. I would also like to have a handful of smaller projects uploaded to GitHub before the end of next summer.\n",
      "9972 Im new to data science and would like to know what you think the best programming languages are in the current state of the field.\n",
      "9973 As an analyst my resolution is to scrutinize each element of my reports and dashboards more. I tend to focus more on the big picture and forget to focus on how each element could be improved. As someone who is trying to learn data science my resolution is to give myself a project that seems achievable and finish it by the end of the year. Documenting is one I think almost all of us can work on.\n",
      "9974 I can't imagine explaining data science, I have enough trouble as it is explaining my job as a data analyst. It has gotten to the point where I explain data as paint, a blank excel or power bi file as a canvas, and my job is to paint a picture that speaks to my audience. Still think only half of my friends really understand. Most just say \"oh so you know how to do pivot tables\" and move on.\n",

      "9982 I feel like the creativity mindset is SOOO important. I'm currently still looking for my first data science/analytics job, but while on the lookout I'm working on my own projects. It definitely takes a lot of creativity to approach certain problems you want to find an answer to.\n",
      "9983 Really enjoying your vids, Ken. You could easily just make a bunch of those flashy \"salary of a data scientist\" or \"day in the life of a data scientist\" videos that have been beaten into the ground by every other youtuber, but instead you're sharing much more relevant and actionable info. Keep it up!\n",

      "9990 hey Ken can you plzz suggest me some data science projects\n",
      "9991 Hey Ken, AMAZING video!!! If I collect my own data, how can I reference it in the GitHub? Is it a good practice to add the CSV/txt file in the repository?\n",
      "9992 Loving ur channel so far. Sports analytics (basketball) is the reason im getting into data science. I participated in the NBA hackathon last year, making it to second phase. I plan on continuing my studies and go to the hackathon every year. Keep up the great work, loving these type of videos\n",
      "9993 Ken, TNX for very informative video. Just if you need an idea regarding new videos, I would be interested in your way to learn and apply new stuff effectively. There is so much to learn on a regular basis. It's currently tough for me to grasp, what is really worth to spend time on (e.g. learning statistics theory vs hand-on experince by try and error).\n",
      "9994 Ken, great video. Can you post that spreadsheet to github? I come from a non technical background. My major is supply chain management with a minor in information systems. I took a data science course and did well in it. The course mainly covered more advanced statistical concepts, not so much of programming (I lack in computer skills the most). I really enjoyed the course. I currently work as a business analyst. I am considering taking your advice to get a master's degree in Data Science from the University of Michigan. Thanks for the information you provide on this channel!\n",
      "9995 Hello Ken, thank you for everything you are making on YouTube. It has been extremely helpful. I was wondering, could you go more in-depth into what data scientists for NBA teams are currently working on? I have trouble knowing what projects could create value because clubs seem to protect all of their in-house work.\n",
      "9996 I am tossing between Statistics or Applied and Computational Mathematics as my major but I can't seem to figure out which one I should do. I like data analysis and using R but I also like mathematical modelling with differential equations and such. Most of the uncertainty for me comes from not knowing the type of work I would be doing in the real world. Do you have any advice? PS. Very informative video, first time watching.\n",
      "9997 Hi Ken , your videos are very informative and keep me motivated on my data science journey. If you can please make more videos on the fundamentals of data science , it would be very helpful. Thank you\n",
      "9998 thank you sir\n",
      "9999 100% agreed.\n",
      "10000 Hi ken Im pursuing a masters in applied statistics and data analytics with an emphasis in biostatistics i find that it might be overkill for doing data science. My original goal was to apply learned knowledge as a biostatisician but throughout this entire year I've just been more drawn to data science and its business applications and am now leaning towards the business analytics concentration. Nonetheless, super stoked for the future and truly enjoy watching your channel. Only a matter of time until you explode! p.s. also calculus was the first class I was not able to pass and also recovering from it lol\n",
      "10001 Great information!!\n",
      "10002 Hi Ken, I'm very interested in Data Science, but I want to make sure I have my mathematics and statistics down. Care to do a video on types of math and stat classes that I might want to take?\n",
      "10003 Appreciate the vids man. Love that you incorporate NBA analytics in your channel Any recommendations for becoming a self taught DS? Taking the DataQuest DS/Python course right now. It's been more hands on than other ones like Coursera which helps me learn better. Any suggestions to accelerate the journey would be awesome. Thanks man. #GiannisWinsMVP\n",
      "10004 Ken, great stuff! Thanks for walking us through your simulation. Quick question: the way you calculate the score seems to skew the comparisons if one of the scores is high. For example: If one team score is say 140-139 it averages to approx 140. The other team score is 120-90. It averages 105. So the team that won by 1 gets the win in the sim cause they scored a lot of points. But the other team won by 30 and had a better defense. Do you see my point? I'm thinking you ought to subtract and return a margin of victory then compare the margin of victory. Maybe worth running simulations to see how different they are? Thanks again!\n",
      "10005 Hey Ken, I'm a systems engineer and aspiring Data Scientist in Haiti, trying to incorporate automation and analytics in as many data structures as I can here (as this field is basically non-existent in my country). As your channel is relatively new and growing, I wanted to make a point to say thank you for your time and attention to detail in your videos. They're not only extremely educational and helpful, but have also helped me stay motivated to keep learning in a field where I am alone and have to rely on virtual help from individuals like yourself. Hope this message serves as encouragement to keep going, and to know that your efforts are seen and appreciated across borders. All the best, Pascal Brun\n",

      "10020 This is a great analysis! It highlights in many ways the value of a caddy and the strategy that goes into every shot. I imagine that players get printouts of each hole at a tournament and can gauge what risks are worth taking and which spots on the course that should be avoided at all costs.\n",
      "10021 Please can you told me, how do you find your first client\n",

      "10041 Great content! Your videos give me a great insight into the career field I am wanting to get into. I must say your are spot on when you mentioned happiness and how being stimulated by working on something can drive happiness! Seeking happiness and a career field with mental stimulation may be the number one driving factor as to why I am wanting to enter this career field, not to mention the other perks as well.\n",
      "10042 Yes, data science is right for me in probably more ways than the number of roommates I've had the last 7 years, which is too many! lol However, like you said in one of your comments below, getting into the field ASAP through being a data analyst would probably be a better bet for someone in my situation who is severely underemployed, has loads of debt, and wants to have a better quality of life. In all honesty, I would be quite content with a data analyst role. I would see it as a stepping stone and an opportunity to improve in all areas in life. I see becoming a data scientist with an emphasis on big data engineering or machine learning engineering as long term goals and becoming a data analyst as more of a short term goal (18-24 months), with luck and or strategic networking maybe 12-15 months.\n",
      "10043 Would you have a method similar to this for scraping facebook data?\n",
      "10044 I have a masters in exercise science, but I want to get into data science/machine learning. I am looking at the University of Denver's masters program in data science and they do have courses in machine learning but from what I read in some of their course descriptions they use Java instead of Python or R. I seem to read that Python and or R are the two main programming languages used in data science. Being that I have no experience in the computer science field should I go for this type of program or should I go for a masters in computer science at my local university which also has courses on advanced algorithms and machine learning?\n",
      "10045 Thank you! Awesome tutorial and an amazing find. Btw could you perhaps also do a video on how to get a library of users from twitterscrapper?

      "10048 Thank you for sharing!!\n",
      "10049 After publishing the video, it appears that I left out an extremely important part of selling! You need to understand your customer and make sure that you are providing an analysis that is relevant to their end goals. If you are speaking to business stakeholders, they are usually focused on profit / loss, user experience, or other performance metrics. Make sure that you are tying the value of your work to these metrics that are important to them. Thanks again for watching!\n",

It's brought me closer to my objective than anything else ;-) But, when I input this line : tweets = query_tweets(#hungergames, begindate = begin_date, enddate = end_date, limit = limit, lang = lang) it hangs on ... (this might mean sth in python. New python user here, so I *think* it is asking for more code???) Or does using a hastag mess things up?\n",

I tried to set the sartdate as 2015.01.01 and enddate is today, but I can only got Tweets from 2019.10.14 to today. How can I get the old data? Because it seems we can get much more older data using Twitterscraper. Thank you. Looking forward to your reply!\n",
      "10055 I thought for sure I could be the annoying guy that said you forgot about how the 4 pt shot helps the value of a 3 pt shot. I was wrong! great video as usual.

      "10077 Love this video and this kind of content. I can imagine that if the line was moved back to 25 feet that there would be a massive trickle down effect. Great shooters would be even more valuable and spacing would be insane in the nba for teams who can convert from that far out. Corner threes would be a cheat code at that point too since they cant be moved back any further. I wonder if the court will ever get bigger to address this. I for one like how the NBA is played right now but am always fascinated by major changes and how teams adapt.\n",

      "10080 Hi!! I was actually struggling on an assignment for hours together and finally encountered your video..it solved my issues within minutes..I immediately subscribed and ended up on this one..Keep doing more videos..You rock!!\n",
      "10081 hi this year I'm going to finish school and I have to chose a career so which career would u think which is better ? (IT, statist or business) thank u\n",
      "10082 After long time. !! Was waiting for your new video..\n",
      "10083 The 7th habit is using the whiteboard which doesn't have to be too big. Good stuff to do mind-mapping before getting into daily work. \n",
      "10084 THANK YOU SOOOOOO MUCH!!!!!!!!!\n",
      "10085 Hi Ken, thank you for creating the channel. i like all your videos, especially the fundamental ones as i can follow and utilize it to analyse other datasets from Kaggle and hopefully create my own projects as my package for Business Intelligence type of role interview. (as I'm an MBA student worked years in marketing.)\n",
      "10086 How much flexible are the working hours? Is it that you have work daily for 6-7 hrs or weekly goals are there? Can we pursue other career and do the work of data scientist simultaneously ( as a part time ) ?\n",
      "10087 Great job. I like seeing the project end-to-end. I have avoided web scraping because I'm still unclear on when it's OK to do it and when it's not (and I'm the kind of person who avoids at all costs doing something that might get me in trouble. ) I've read quite a few robots.txt files and many of them specifically disallow crawlers other than the usual search engines, yet some people feel comfortable scraping those sites. Do you have any guidelines for deciding when it is OK to scrape and when it isn't?\n",
      "10088 I like Kaggle for its competitions and for its kernels which, as you said, are one of the best ways of learning practical data science lessons. Also, I love YouTube, even though I do most of my learning from reading not from watching videos. The reason YouTube feels special is that some YouTubers are great at storytelling. They help me have a more personal connection to what I'm learning. \n",
      "10089 I watched every video of this channel more than 3 times. Seriously!\n",
      "10090 this long-sleeve t-shirt link?? lmao\n",
      "10091 Hi Ken, I am an Industrial Engineering graduate student with a keen interest in data and supply chain. Can you tell me something about how the scope will be like if I enter into the field of data as I am bit ambiguous in which area do I need to do research or project?\n",
      "10092 Your advice is spot on: 1. be prepared to put a lot of time and effort into learning (in truth, the learning never stops. ) 2. be proactive about finding problems and solving them (plus, keep in mind there's a difference between asking for help because you're truly stuck vs. asking for help because you're too lazy to figure out how to solve a problem. Data scientists are supposed to be really good at problem solving. Being a data scientist who's asking for help all the time kind of undermines the purpose of being a data scientist. 3. learn the math (I actually believe that most people have the ability to understand the math but, most have been taught math in a way that's not relevant enough nor interesting enough to them. When done right, I can't see how anyone can not love math.) 4. learn coding 5. tell great stories Also, a quote I heard recently, makes a nice addition: \"For some, data science is an opportunity. For me, data science is a passion.\" When you go into the field for the right reasons, you'll do whatever it takes to get great at it. I enjoyed watching this video. Keep up the great work.\n",
      "10093 @Ken Lee I've just discovered your channel. You're doing a very nice job with your videos (a balance of practical tips and encouraging advice.) Keep up the great work. \n",
      "10094 Hi Ken, thanks for the video. Is there a way to segment the age and the country ?\n",
      "10095 Hi Kan, Could you make a video tutorial on Feature engineering?. Not the basic fiillna(), one hot encoding etc. I mean some advanced feature engineering techniques(like X=x/y etc). It will be much helpful for people like me. Thanks and have a good day\n",
      "10096 Hey man, congratulations on the milestone! I'm so proud of you. Can you make a data science 101 course ? that would be really helpful :)\n",
      "10097 hey man! congrats on the milestone! I think main request would be projects start to finish. big or small doesn't matter. I just think there's plenty of theoretical content out there (books, videos, etc) but building helps to solidify learning! As a new ML student, that's what i'd love to see\n",
      "10098 Congrats Ken!! Definitely deserve more!\n",
      "10099 Wish 1000000\n",
      "10100 Congratulations on 1k subscribers. Still many to come. N yeah your contents have definitely helped me .thank you n keep it up.\n",

      "10107 Hey Ken, I've opted for Data Science as my majors in my university, but I've a keen interest in Artificial Intelligence and Machine learning. Can you explain how data science can help me work in AI and ML?\n",
      "10108 Good to see you\n",
      "10109 Good content!! Keep it up,\n",
      "10110 Hey Ken, I have a few data science projects(python/sql) that i'm working on while taking edx classes but also work full-time as mech engineer trying to switch careers. The emphasis on masters seems to be quite apparent among DS jobs especially in Cali. If I want to go through masters in cs, i would have to be part-time(financial reasons) but also put all my projects on hold due to time constraint. It would take roughly 1 year for me to get around solid 4-5 projects to complete but 2.5 years for my masters. What are your thoughts about this? going the personal project route or masters route? I wish I can do both but that is a recipe for a burnout. I enjoy the technicality of DS and want to get into the industry asap. great vid btw!\n",
      "10111 thanks\n",
      "10112 Lol this video showed more of you not working than actually working. 3 minutes in and you haven't started working yet.\n",
      "10113 Liked your video.. again.. Thank u for ur efforts. Really appreciate it. \n",

      "10121 Hey ken! I just completed my graduation and I am currently doing data science course from a local reputated institute. Our exposure to actual real world work is v minimum. So some advice from a person like you will mean a lott.\n",
      "10122 Thanks Ken\n",
      "10123 Hey Ken, thanks for another great video! I have a question regarding working for a non-profit or a small company though. Do you literally knock on their door and ask if you could apply your skills to their project? I was thinking of doing this as an option if I don't get an internship before I graduate.\n",
      "10124 Do you sleep? Keep churning out this quality content ken!\n",
      "10125 Hey Ken, I heard that one needs to have an advanced degree or a lot of knowledge in calculus and statistics in order to get a job in data science. Im interested in getting into data science and big data but am not sure about having the required formal education with advanced mathematics. Thanks!\n",

      "10136 Comment first, then watch!\n",
      "10137 u jost got urself a fellow data science student subscriber !\n",
      "10138 Hey PSA (maybe pin this or comment this yourself) but 1.2.0 as of right now doesn't really work. It's query_tweets is broken and you're going to have to specifically install 1.1.0 (pip install twitterscraper==1.1.0) in order to use it. Also, for anyone wondering about performance issues and harvesting tons of tweets, make use of the poolsize parameter. Poolsize controls the number of parallel scrapers you can have up at a single time. At maximum you can have one scraper per day. So for example, if you are scraping a period of 30 days, you can use poolsize=30 to get 30 parallel scrapers running at a time. If you want to harvest over a big time frame, try to harvest smaller time periods and loop through dates manually (otherwise your CPU, RAM, and internet usage will shoot through the roof). That should give you the best mix of performance and speed.\n",

      "10150 One more question, if I would like to write the tweets (from this method, with a track word) to a json file how do I access the tweet info? For example, when I want to print the tweets: <twitterscraper.tweet.Tweet object at 0x10b0d8240> I get something like this, which I understand but I'm not sure how to retrieve the actual information from it. Looking at API documentation, the tweet object should have attributes like 'text' and 'id' and so on. But when I try tweets['text'] I get an error instead. DO you know how I could write it into a file? (also by not using pandas as there is an issue with that library on my end currently which I haven't been able to fix unfortunately)\n",
