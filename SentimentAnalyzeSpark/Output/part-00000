Comment = watching in early 2022. i really like this breakdown of process and how to think about solving problems. i'm a musician, producer and recording engineer and a lot of these....learn-by-doing and divergent thought processes remind me a lot of how to get a good mix or composing. really excited on this journey

Comment = i am impressed by this video, especially the parts about habits and "learning about learning." as to sound during study, i don't do well with any music or speaking that i understand; random sounds (beaches, rain, wildlife, radio noise) is better. lol, if there's silence, my mind wanders into some distracting worries...

Comment = great video, ken! i can relate to the inability to listen to music with words while i study. there's too much conflict in my mind that i can't focus on the subject at hand.

Comment = thank you for this great video! i've already subscribed to your channel, digging to find a lots of ds insights )) but please improve the audio quality in future videos: background noises are really frustrating, and a background music seems to be a little bit loud. but again, you're making a great resource that is very useful for data science beginners like me!

Comment = great content as always. i have a question, maybe it will help others too. i'm starting fresh in the ds journey. there's one thing that got me a bit discouraged, and i felt you targeted this issue in one of your videos too: one of the big reasons i decided to switch to ds is being an international career; i saw myself joining a firm, and later switching jobs, industries, even countries very easily (just like software engineers ^^). however, i sensed that it's not the case with ds? i sensed like if i joined a certain industry as data scientist, my skills won't be easily transferable to other industries. for example, you joined the ds world in the sport industry, right? do you feel your experience is easily transferred to other industries (like automotive, social media, music, retail, etc...). landing a job in a different company/industry is easy? your opinion is much appreciated!

Comment = man i wish i had seen this sooner, definitely clears up so much. although, now i realize i've never actually even worked on git locally and just do all my work(projects) on github, is that okay or should i learn how to use git locally? also digging the music!

Comment = great interview! as someone from europe i am particularly interested in the entire process outside of the us, since currently there is not a lot of information on this topic online. one small note; at some points in the video, especially when the audio of you talking is a bit low, the music makes it a bit more difficult to follow along. still an awesome discussion tho! :)

Comment = hi ken, i've been watching your content for a while now, and i love what you put out. thank you for the videos. i do have a small request. could you perhaps remove the background music in your videos? sometimes the music comes off as irritating and given that the main content of your videos is the dialogue, i feel like it's unnecessary to have the background music for the type of videos you make. keep putting out the great content! i'm learning a lot from you :)

Comment = i am an entry level software engineer in the pension domain. but i want to work in the data science field for music technology, specifically music information retrieval. i have an average programming experience through matlab and c++. i will be following some of your tips to get started on my data science journey but this was definitely motivational and directional.

Comment = hi ken, i need your honest opinion man i'm confused in choosing between data scientist or ux designer there are few questions about this topic, but i want to ask from different perspective i am right now a content creator, was a videographer so i do edit videos and such visualization is always a part of me, i like to vizualize things like when i hear music i can imagine the videos that fits the music but what i asked is much bigger than that i know lots of people talk about what you're more into, if maths go with data science, if creative go with ux design however, i want to know how's the life of both careers? which one offer better work life balance? because when i did creative work, i didn't really have work life balance, i did a lot of overwork stuffs, because creative work sometimes requires you to think constantly or out of the box that really absorbed your attention even outside of your work hours. when i go outside, my body is in holiday mode but my mind is not there, thinking of the unfinished project. then second, which one is more important and irreplaceable? because i see lots of websites now offering design templates which mean maybe in the future, companies don't really need ux designer since they can use good templates from the internet. third, when you become the ceo of the company. which skill is best to master? data science or ux design? that will absolute critical as someone in that position. like to hear your thoughts about this, thank you

Comment = fascinating. i could listen to this for hours. had no idea analytics was involved in recruiting. would love to hear more about how you might help a team develop strategies on how to beat a specific opponent. i appreciate what you sent me on linkedin a month or so ago, but i'm very behind on my reading. george musick

Comment = thanks ken for the work from home tips, agree with you that a dedicated work space helps to boost productivity. what also works for me is a good background music as a sort of white noise (helps to be in the zone).

Comment = this video helped a bunch! im a high school senior who is torn between my major for next year. im deciding between music and sports business/marketing. im pretty well versed with how the sports world works due to just falling in love with sports in general. is there any chance i could get your email? i would love to be able to chat about this field!
